\f1 \cf3 Hi Team,\
\
I just wanted to give an update on the content feeds that are available for our web version of The Scoop. \'a0It looks like we have access to everything that we need to build things out on top of the Conmio-based CMS that powers the existing iPhone application.\
\
For those interested in the details, there's a JSON file that serves as the index for each of the categories of content and points to the individual feeds for the content within each category. \'a0As long as we structure the UI based around the same categories in the iPhone application, it should be straightforward. \'a0Here are the feeds if you care to take a look:\
\
Index: \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/category/newcategorylist.json"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/category/newcategorylist.json}}\
\
Restaurants: \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/thesiftyfifty"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/thesiftyfifty}}\
\
Bars: \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/thetopshelf"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/thetopshelf}}\
\
Coffee: \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/coffeeshops"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/coffeeshops}}\
\
Events: \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/thisweek"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/thisweek}}\
\
Only in N.Y.: \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/timeless"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/timeless}}\
\
Day Trips: \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/daytrips"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/daytrips}}\
\
Home Furnishings: \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/househome"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/househome}}\
\
Shopping: \'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/shopping"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 http://mobile.nytimes.com/iphone/scoop/list/shopping}}\
\
We'll chat more on Friday at our 2p meeting, but let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.\
\
Thanks,\
Chris\
