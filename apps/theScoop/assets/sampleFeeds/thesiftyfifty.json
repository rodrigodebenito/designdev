"ANOTHER day, another restaurant from Jean-Georges Vongerichten. The latest is ABC Kitchen, a winsome sprawl on the ground floor of ABC Carpet & Home, luxe Manhattan\u2019s best source for Ganesh statues and pillows marked with nautical signal flags. As has become custom for Mr. Vongerichten of late, it is very good."
,"The notion of the place is haute organic and Hamptons sustainable. The restaurant is airy and open and relaxed the way the second homes of the wealthy often are, with LED-style lighting over warm floors. Ingredients for the cooking, as a position paper on the back of the chic cardboard menu declares, are \"consciously sourced.\" The breadbaskets were \"handcrafted by the indigenous Mapuche people of Patagonia.\""
,"The words tumble out like refrigerator magnets onto the table. Everything here is: Fair trade! Globally artistic! Reclaimed and recycled! Soy-based! Post-consumer fiber!"
,"You meet people like this. Only when they are spectacularly good-looking and appear to be attracted to you are they manageable."
,"ABC Kitchen pulls off the magic trick. The food is great and not terribly expensive. It is a pretty room. The crowd runs high-wattage with net worth to match."
,"And the servers, who might be made up of the combined casts of \"Glee\" and \"Friday Night Lights,\" employ a fast-casual style that is a variation on the one at Mr. Vongerichten\u2019s Spice Market. The service at ABC Kitchen resembles nothing so much as what you\u2019d probably get out of the house staff at a weekend getaway with Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg."
,"Shall we eat, darlings? For a farm-to-table restaurant, ABC Kitchen sure has a long diner-style menu: 46 items, from crudit\u00E9s with an anchovy dip at its top to baked endive with ham and Gruy\u00E8re at the bottom. There are delicate farmers\u2019-garden salads along the way, chewy whole-wheat pastas, college-educated cows and monkish chickens. It can be difficult to know where to begin."
,"Here\u2019s how: with fiddlehead ferns roasted in the wood oven, as fragrant and earthy as the forest floor, a complete rejoinder to the food world\u2019s fascination with ramps. Also with a large hunk of toast slathered in rich, creamy chicken-liver mousse, or sweet, briny peekytoe crab meat. With roasted portobellos scented with celery leaves, one of the great underappreciated tastes of the refrigerator crisper box."
,"Have these while you\u2019re considering the rest of the menu, along with a bottle of Rolly Gassmann pinot noir, and life starts to look pretty good. Might head down to St. Bart\u2019s next month after all. It\u2019s much more pleasant in the off-season."
,"The appetizers include a terrific plate of shaved fluke with grapefruit and tarragon, in which the sweetness of the fish melds perfectly with the acidity of the grapefruit, while the tarragon does a dance around the base."
,"There are also baby leeks vinaigrette, one of those perfect French dishes Mr. Vongerichten sometimes throws into his menus to establish a baseline classical melody off which to riff. Dan Kluger, the restaurant\u2019s executive chef, a veteran of Tom Colicchio\u2019s kitchens and Danny Meyer\u2019s, cooks it as well as the master, with real finesse."
,"Oven-roasted asparagus is terrific as well, as is a salad of endive, Treviso radicchio and sugar-snap peas with tiny herbs and a dressing rich with Parmesan and cut down by Champagne vinegar. Taste that lime juice? That\u2019s Mr. Vongerichten starting to play."
,"Calamari coated in crushed pretzels is a failure, sadly, damp beneath its salty coating, with a whipped mustard aioli. But baby greens with sprouts, in a tangy dressing enlivened by lemon and yogurt, swings back toward success; a sweet mackerel sashimi fired by ginger and softened by mint pins the needle there."
,"Pastas are only occasionally exciting, as in the ricotta-rich, black-pepper-showered cavatelli with guanciale, ramps, fava beans, peas and pecorino."
,"But a few pizzas for your table would not be in error, starting with the delicious morels with Parmesan, oregano and a soft large-yolked egg. Clams with mint, parsley and fresh chilies was on one night sublime, about the best bivalve pizza on the planet: salty with a ping of fire, incandescent with flavor and texture above its soft, charred whole-wheat crust. It was overcooked and underseasoned on another evening, more like the third-best personal pizza available above 14th Street."
,"The best of the entrees include a black sea bass with chilies, herbs, red bliss potatoes and spinach that can serve as an object lesson in Mr. Vongerichten\u2019s and Mr. Kluger\u2019s cooking. The fillet is scented with marjoram and mint, basil, dill and jalape\u00F1o, then roasted. The potatoes, meanwhile, cook in water infused with rosemary and tarragon, lemon zest, ginger. These all come together on the plate, with wilted spinach beneath a drizzle of olive oil and a bit of sweet lemon confit, with a soft yet crisp, sweet yet fiery precision."
,"But steamed halibut with shiitakes, avocado and juiced asparagus isn\u2019t chipped beef, not by a long shot. And while the strip steak is a chew, it still comes with brilliant glazed carrots and oyster mushrooms, worth ordering on their own."
,"As at the Mark Restaurant by Jean-Georges, a restaurant Mr. Vongerichten recently opened on the Upper East Side, there is a hamburger on the menu. It is better here than uptown, with its tangy Akaushi-beef flavor, snappy pickled jalape\u00F1os, arugula- and basil-rich mayonnaise, sharp Cato Corner cheese and soft Eli\u2019s bun. Also as at the Mark, there is a split-open, oven-roasted lobster, here seasoned with an almost-spicy vinaigrette that shines with lemon: sustainable luxury at $35 a throw."
,"Desserts are quite plain at ABC Kitchen, as if to avoid competing with the easy luxury of the surroundings and the deceptive simplicity of the entrees: fruit and sorbets; crumbles and pies. The best is a sundae comprised of salted caramel-peanut ice cream and candied popcorn, with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. It is the sort of thing you might eat on a Friday night as the traffic clears out on the L.I.E., before the drive out to Southampton for the weekend."
,"Perhaps that sounds cynical? It sure wouldn\u2019t if that\u2019s what you were doing after the meal. And that\u2019s the point of ABC Kitchen entirely: It represents fantasy, wealth without guilt, socially responsible hedonism. Resistance is futile. Obey."

"HERE at long last is a winning new defense of fine dining: Ai Fiori, in the Setai Fifth Avenue hotel, just below Midtown. The chef and restaurateur Michael White opened the place late last year, with Chris Jaeckle in the kitchen and Ahmass Fakahany down at the bank. It is an emphatic rejoinder to the trend toward farmhouse tables, rustic food and shouting that has so dominated the dining scene in Manhattan at least since the start of the recession."
,"Ai Fiori is not really a beautiful restaurant, despite the Childe Hassam-ish views that its wide windows provide of Fifth Avenue. The color palette of the dining room is too earthen and anonymous. And the service is not quite formal enough for it to qualify as truly fancy, either - more Danny Meyer in attitude than Alain Ducasse. (Though check out those forks set in the high-European manner, with the tines pointing down into the thick tablecloth!) As a hotel restaurant, Ai Fiori is open for three meals a day. Some guests arrive tieless and Dockered, in drab pantsuits or business-travel black. There can be no purse ottomans for them, or other trappings of restaurants that seek to occupy the city\u2019s highest tier."
,"But the dinner menu is a soulful amalgamation of French technique and Italian passion, executed with great skill. It turns an Italian lens on haute French cooking to reveal French food as it might be cooked in Como for a table of aristocrats. This works out well for everyone: Ai Fiori is one of the best restaurants to open in New York in the last 12 months. (With its $79 four-course prix fixe, it also provides one of the best values.)"
,"A meal at Ai Fiori (The name means \"among the flowers.\") could begin with a half-pipe of beef bone filled elegantly with rounds of celery root, thin-sliced scallop and black truffle, with a thick drizzle of bone marrow over the top and a scattering of thyme. It might start with a tender pile of buttery poached oysters with cucumber and sturgeon caviar."
,"For those with a taste for offal and seafood, there is a soft-poached egg served with crisp sweetbreads, braised lobster knuckles, more of that black truffle and some tarragon. The egg is swathed in a cloud of cr\u00E8me fra&#238;che and Coteaux du Layon, the sweet white wine of the Loire Valley. The combination is sweet and sour, slick and crunchy, all at once."
,"There is a roasted breast of squab as well, its shatteringly crisp skin giving way to soft and gamy meat below, with a sticky Madeira sauce, a cotton-ball pur\u00E9e of parsnips and a golden croquette filled with liquefied foie gras. This tastes of wealth and self-satisfaction. It is the gustatory version of one of those William Hamilton cartoons, \"Money Should Be Fun.\""
,"And these are just appetizers! (Others include a marvelous salad of blue crab and grapefruit, avocado, tarragon and crisp flatbread, and a thick and glossy lobster velout\u00E9 with shaved chestnut and yet more black truffles, which Mr. White uses at Ai Fiori the way some chefs use salt or pepper.) What is going on here?"
,"A vest-pocket history: Mr. White was the chef at Fiamma Osteria in SoHo, where he was known as a pasta magician. In 2002, the restaurant received three stars from The New York Times. Later, he was the chef at both Alto and Convivio, where he cooked northern and southern Italian food, respectively. Those restaurants also received three stars from The Times."
,"With Chris Cannon, his erstwhile business partner, who had hired him for Alto and Convivio, Mr. White launched the elegant and Italianate seafood palace Marea on Central Park South in 2009 (three stars again), and the more casual Osteria Morini, devoted to the food of Emilia-Romagna, in SoHo last year (one star)."
,"AT Ai Fiori, the idea is to commingle the cooking of the south of France, where Mr. White worked in the early 1990s, and the northwesterly Italian cuisine of the Ligurian coast. (The dining room, meanwhile, supports an atmosphere that is more in line with the bland veneers of American corporate culture than anything European: it really might be anywhere.)"
,"So, yes, there are a few pastas to eat after the excess of the appetizer course. They follow the starters like a run of good cards: delicate little gnocchi made of semolina flour and scented with saffron, then served with crab meat, tomato and lobes of sea urchin; a feather-light plate of wine-glazed ravioli stuffed with ricotta and mascarpone, with truffle-infused boschetto cheese; and braised veal agnolotti with a brush of butternut squash and sugo that appears composed mostly of butter and (naturally) black truffles."
,"There are a few risottos as well. These are not as magic but they are hardly clunkers, especially since one is dressed with escargot and bits of cotechino sausage and another with a comically large portion of our old familiar black truffle and a lashing of veal stock."
,"Eaten alongside wines to match - relatively inexpensive Ligurian treasures pulled forth by Hristo Zisovski, the restaurant\u2019s beverage director, who came to Ai Fiori from Jean Georges; or a Norman cider, or glasses of Pauillac - they help set the stage for a meal that moves well beyond the familiar Italian boundaries of what Mr. White has heretofore cooked in New York."
,"Dessert follows suit, with a selection from the pastry chef Robert Truitt that pays deep compliment to the savory food without overshadowing it. Among the best is the baba al rhum. It is a king\u2019s dish, Neapolitan by way of France, served here with a passion-fruit coulis and a small arrangement of tropical fruit."
,"The restaurant\u2019s veal chop, as another example, comes with a sweetbread choux farci and sauce P\u00E9rigueux, the meat seared hard in a pan and finished slowly in a low-temperature oven. It arrives at the table sweet and flavorful beneath a gloss of butter and garlic and thyme and rosemary, a taste of the south of France, hardly Italian at all."
,"Pan-fried sole is served with a nutty brown-butter sauce thickened with cream and veal stock, then lightened with lemon juice and thyme, made salty with capers. Butter-poached lobster comes with root vegetables and a paint-thick sauce of butter, vin jaune, lobster essence and a jolt of acidity that owes something to the cooking of Jean-Georges Vongerichten. The dish nods respectfully as well to Thomas Keller, who originated butter-poached lobster at the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif. Then it dunks on both of them."
,"And rack of lamb shows up as individual chops wrapped in a grind of breast meat and foie gras that have been sealed in caul fat beneath a single crest of flattened parsley. Heated to melting, mahogany perfection, they sit regal and massive on the table in the manner of an edible Jeff Koons sculpture: shiny, intensely flavored, magnificent."
,"There may be prettier restaurants in the world of Michael White. But the cooking is at its very top here at the Setai. Oui, chef!"

"ANELLA is an intimate little art house of a restaurant on a block in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, that might be a rough part of Paris or an old part of Boston, some forgotten corner of a city that can reach back into the 19th century for building stock and scale. The wind whips in off the East River there sharp as razors, and old women squabble in Polish on the street. You will need your adventure boots to get there, perhaps."
,"But the narrow bar and dining room are warm as candlelight, decorated in that nice urban variation on farmhouse chic that is common to restaurants in north Brooklyn, all brick and reclaimed hardwood, with Edison bulbs hanging from the tin ceiling that cast shadows over pockmarked plaster and ancient paint. (Beards and cardigans abound at the tables, as well as vintage dresses, heavy clogs.) Service is easygoing, nice."
,"And the food is a wonder: a tight and focused menu of simple, seasonally appropriate food from Joseph Ogrodnek, a talented chef who has been in the kitchen for almost a year."
,"It is by no means a formal restaurant. There is a worn A.T.M. in the back. Drafts circulate in the winter\u2019s chill, and the U-shape of the bar and dining room can lead to what traffic engineers call flow issues. Those Edison lights are so dim, it can be hard to read the brief menu."
,"Still, for those amenable to a New Year\u2019s resolution to travel the city more, to move beyond old familiar haunts to taste the new and delicious, Anella is a decent place to discover the nexus of geography and emotion."
,"We are all in this maze together. Parts of it have really good restaurants."
,"A flowerpot of bread will start your meal, the loaf served vertically within it in the manner of a cartoon mushroom, warm and cut into four wedges, with soft salted butter. It tastes of care and eccentricity combined, the work of a hippie mom in advance of a performance of madrigals: rich and white and plump. It calls for mulled wine; a wicked Manhattan does the trick as well, poured over plump little cherries steeped in brandy. (Wine can follow, off a reasonable list that runs at the Old World more than the New.)"
,"Mr. Ogrodnek is a skilled practitioner of the vegetable arts. Like Midas, who turned everything he touched into gold (and like Dave Pasternack at Esca in Midtown, who achieves similar results with fish), he elevates the simplest greens and tubers into realms more celestial than those we are generally used to in wintertime in New York City."
,"\"Roasted broccoli,\" reads his menu. \"Watercress, parmesan, lemon.\" Well, yes. It has the flavor of everything good that can happen on a farm, with a pure vegetal sweetness enhanced in great measure by the peppery cress, the salty cheese, the acidic zing of citrus."
,"A roasted beet salad achieves similar heights, with walnuts and baby greens, and little dabs of the mild, almost sweet blue cheese called gorgonzola dolce. So does a peppery green salad with apples, pecans and bits of sharp, nutty, English-style Cabot Cheddar, and another of sunchokes shaved thin, then served with orange segments, pebbles of pistachio and a few sheets of pecorino."
,"This is dirt wizard food of high caliber, cooking that leads people to join community-supported agriculture programs and fill their homes with parsnips and kale."
,"But Mr. Ogrodnek does not ignore the pleasures of the flesh. He put in time with Alain Ducasse at the Essex House, then at Gramercy Tavern, followed by a turn with Jean-Georges Vongerichten at the Mark. He can cook with the confident sneer of a Frenchman."
,"His steak tartare is a robust and flavorful thing, served beside crisp-cooked artichokes and a soft mound of oil-slicked herbs. His golden leg of duck confit with a pool of smoky, bacon-studded lentils happily straddles the crisp-soft divide. He takes sweet Chatham cod and pairs it with zucchini, broccoli, basil and a hint of chili fire, cooking the fish to beautiful flakiness, so that it slides apart under the least pressure from a fork."
,"A fat pork chop, teamed with yams, maple syrup and pecans, nods to an America we all wish we lived in, where the pigs are fat and healthy instead of lean and terrifying, and yams taste of the earth and the sky, not marshmallows and despair. It may profile on the menu as too sweet because of the vegetable and the syrup. But there is harmony among all flavors, and it makes a marvelous dish."
,"There are pastas as well: a short rigatoni with pancetta, brussels sprouts and parmesan, the dish lightened with lemon juice; and a straightforward puttanesca that is a neighborhood favorite, a regular\u2019s dish, suitable for weekly dinner at the bar, which was assembled from salvaged worktables from the Steinway piano factory in Astoria, Queens. (The regulars return in droves for Sunday brunch, which offers eggs and granola, crisp French toast and a hamburger that would do good service on the regular dinner menu, at least as an occasional special.)"
,"And do you remember when there was fried calamari on every third menu in New York, when those greasy rings were the sliders of their day? At Anella, the dish makes a return alongside silky anchovy mayonnaise as if to remind us why we once loved it. Steamed mussels come in a broth made fiery with soppressata and red onions, with delicate, earthy potato fries on the side. They are, likewise, a familiar dish made fresh in the execution."
,"It is only in sweets that Mr. Ogrodnek stumbles, and then only in comparison to his work on the savory side. He makes a fine olive-oil cake, though, one worth ordering particularly after a dinner of roast chicken with crisp little fingerlings, creamy feta and a heap of salty, peppery wild arugula. The combination is bliss."
,"\"Sir, respect your dinner,\" wrote Thackeray, thundering. \"Idolize it, enjoy it properly. You will be by many hours in the week, many weeks in the year, and many years in your life the happier if you do.\""
,"Anella has no apparent ambitions beyond making this possible. Annoyingly, it takes no credit cards.. But Mr. Ogrodnek does his level best to make your trip worthwhile. Taxi!"

"IT has been a Swedish summer here in New York. There seem to be Stieg Larsson novels on every fourth lap on the D train choogling over the Manhattan Bridge, on every third iPad glowing in the dark of the jitney driving east on the Long Island Expressway toward Montauk."
,"Meanwhile, over on East 55th Street, in a series of dining rooms on the ground floor of an ugly skyscraper next door to the Friars Club, a new executive chef, Marcus Jernmark, is settling into his clogs at Aquavit, the Scandinavian restaurant long associated with the celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson, who formally left the kitchen there in May. Mr. Jernmark, 28, a former head chef for the Swedish consulate in New York, had been the restaurant\u2019s second in command."
,"Aquavit is now 23. It has been in this location since 2005, when it moved east from the Rockefeller Townhouses, across Fifth Avenue."
,"Up front is a bistro serving fairly traditional Swedish food: meatballs and gravlax. In back, past a long bar, is a formal dining room. It is comfortable if slightly shopworn back there, a company boardroom and meeting space, replete with chic wooden plates and scarred wooden floors. Mikael Blomkvist, the hero of the Larsson novels, might arrive at any moment to blow smoke in the face of a criminal plutocrat."
,"Gone are the fireworks of the Samuelsson era, the high-wire act of matching Scandinavian food to French technique and the flavors of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. (Ruth Reichl of The New York Times awarded the restaurant three stars in 1995. William Grimes did so again in 2001; in 1988, before Mr. Samuelsson\u2019s arrival, the restaurant was given two stars by Bryan Miller.)"
,"Aquavit\u2019s dining room can be somewhat lonely these days, only a little more than half full at peak hours. There is a sour scent to some of the passageways, the sort that flowers cannot battle."
,"But Mr. Jernmark has moved the menu toward a quiet, seasonal intensity that is well worth investigating. Mr. Samuelsson\u2019s cooking used international flair to introduce Scandinavian flavors to Americans who knew only of Midwestern smorgasbords. Mr. Jernmark\u2019s take is at once more modest and difficult, the taste of a Sweden proud of its traditions, its larder and the bounty of its sea, fields and lakes."
,"He smokes sweetbreads in hay, for instance, turning them black and menacing, then serves them as an appetizer alongside a parsnip pur\u00E9e, with fava beans, grilled bread and an apple-cider sauce. A slice reveals a white the color of clouds high over a seaweed-draped shore. The flavors combine with force and severity, offering sweetness, the crunch of salt, the chalkiness of char."
,"Mr. Jernmark is not quite foraging for the felt of reindeer antlers or serving lye-cured fish cheese with lingonberry dressing, as if to reinvent Swedish cooking. But he does offer an appetizer of funky venison tartare, with wood sorrel and huckleberries to provide tartness high in the mouth, and capers and a truffle-y mustard vinaigrette to balance it."
,"And if Beau Soleil oysters are not Swedish, they do maintain the spirit of the region, dressed with a little apple, some pickled rhubarb and a dollop of paddlefish caviar. Only a brook trout poached in brown butter with sea urchin roe, English peas and a lemon pearl sago, a sort of tapioca pearl out of Southeast Asia, offers a hint that Mr. Jernmark has not abandoned Mr. Samuelsson\u2019s restless cosmopolitanism entirely."
,"(Nor all his signature dishes. The restaurant\u2019s excellent Arctic Circle dessert, which pairs a goat-cheese parfait with blueberry sorbet, remains.)"
,"Naturally there is herring. Mr. Jernmark is a master of the baitfish form. A herring degustation plate should start any meal at the restaurant, served with impossibly sweet boiled peanut potatoes, bits of crispy bread and some hard, salty Vasterbotten cheese."
,"Begin, perhaps, with the creamy horseradish version, pale and fiery, or with a ruddier, plump, mustard-hued fillet. Mr. Jernmark serves herring topped with pickled ramps; with bits of crayfish; wrapped around gherkins; or drizzled with more of that brown butter; with roasted yellow beets, a tiny quail egg, red onion, sour cream."
,"Consumed in the traditional style, with glasses of Carlsberg beer and shots of Linie aquavit from Norway, nutty with caraway and herbs, these little bites make it difficult not to see the wisdom of the restaurant\u2019s new-traditionalist approach. (Though you can easily ditch the beer and aquavits, and signal to a sommelier for help; the restaurant\u2019s wine list spans a few continents, and is reasonably affordable and well paired to the menu.)"
,"The entrees continue Mr. Jernmark\u2019s theme, though they are not as successful as the appetizers. He does very well with fish. There is an exceptional dish of seared scallops, fat and sweet, with butter-poached lobster, sauerkraut, quinoa and oyster vinaigrette. (The butter-poached lobster only matters insofar as it sells, and has since Thomas Keller originated the preparation in 1994.)"
,"And a seared arctic char, with cauliflower, salted hazelnuts and a feather-light horseradish emulsion, is wildly flavorful if a little overcomplicated in its preparation (the char is fennel-cured) and plating (it looks like a low-rider car)."
,"Lamb with mustard greens, a soft artichoke stew and garlic stems, is light and gamy, and notable most for its treatment of the delicate artichoke hearts. But it is a dish that would be better with less meat. A pairing of strip steak and braised short ribs falls into the same camp. The beef falls heavily and short of its accompaniments - parsley root and a pile of mushroom duxelles."
,"Better is a duck-breast roulade with potato dumplings known as kroppkakor, along with rainbow Swiss chard, peas and a lingonberry sauce. And a huge fist of pork loin, with a sweet-corn cream, summery succotash and pool of foie gras broth, might have done well at the royal wedding reception, this June, of the Duke and Duchess of Vastergotland."
,"Mr. Jernmark and his staff are cooking and serving excellent food at Aquavit, bold and honest. It is time for the restaurant\u2019s owners to match their commitment, and to freshen up the dining rooms."

"SO here is a young woman sitting in Balaboosta with her parents, explaining the menu to them. She has a boyfriend in tow. The two sides of the table regard each other warily over mash-your-own hummus, as a votive candle flickers against the dusk."
,"The restaurant, a charming and casual Middle Eastern trattoria with Israeli roots that Einat Admony opened near the top end of Little Italy this spring, seems to be filled with such pairings: fathers and daughters, mothers and boyfriends. The older people look around wide-eyed and curious, as if children themselves. The children deal with this as best they can."
,"Interspersed among them are neighborhood couples, weeknight office groups, friends meeting friends under warm wood, beside bookcases and white brick. The talk is of babies and work, Uncle Murray and this summer\u2019s vacations."
,"A pitcher of sangria slakes thirsts developed on the walk down Mulberry Street in the dank humidity of an early summer evening."
,"Then a pizza resplendent in orange and green arrives. The orange is pur\u00E9ed carrot, spiked with the fire of chilies. The green is cilantro, laid over white clouds of goat cheese and lightning bolts of caramelized onion. The crust has a delicate skin that breaks open to reveal a chewy interior, deep in flavor, steaming hot. Possibly this is healthy food? It is addictive all the same."
,"Later, the boyfriend wolfs his dessert, a floral malabi to make Claudia Roden proud. (There\u2019s also a nice date and banana bread pudding.) He dabs at his mouth with a napkin, looks up at the parents in silence. They are drinking organic wine, of which the restaurant has a fine selection, inexpensive and interesting. There are some shy smiles. Who knows how it all will play out?"
,"Balaboosta, Ms. Admony has said, is Yiddish for \"perfect housewife.\" Quibblers will say it\u2019s a Yiddish corruption of the Hebrew term \"baal habayit,\" meaning the master of the house, or boss."
,"The restaurant\u2019s bookcases are in any event filled with cookbooks written by women. A large portrait of an aunt decorates one wall. There is a small bar up front, serving wine but no spirits."
,"Ms. Admony, who also has a popular West Village falafel joint, Taim, stands in the partly open kitchen, her glittering eyes darting everywhere, her dark hair pulled back beneath a kerchief. She runs Balaboosta exactly as if she\u2019d invited a room full of strangers for dinner, then told her family to be nice to them. The floor staff complies - they are professional, well versed in the menu, friendly, even kind. The intimate feel to the restaurant is real."
,"But there is very little that is housewifey about its owner and chef. Her eyes flick this way and that, cutting like knives. Ms. Admony smiles sometimes. She can definitely cook. There is that semi-completed hummus to start, whole chickpeas rising out of a tahini bath in a marble mortar, crushed chickpeas beneath them, ready to be finished with an accompanying pestle. Dip warm, herb-laden pita into the mixture, sparkly with lemon juice, fragrant with roasted garlic. Consumed, it provides a taste of an Israeli idyll, the feeling of a warm breeze off the Mediterranean to ruffle your hair. (If you have hair.)"
,"Then pop a few fried olives into your mouth, crisp and salty beneath their skin, or drag them through a drift of thick, house-made labneh to soften their crunch beneath the yogurt\u2019s tang. Have a ball of falafel wrapped around a tiny meatball, served with a green tahini sauce, a nod to Taim."
,"Ms. Admony gently fries shrimp in a casing of shredded phyllo dough, then drizzles them with a dressing of flying-fish roe that accentuates the sweetness of the meat, the pure crunch of the coating. Three come to an appetizer plate. A moderately interested person could consume six and ask for more."
,"There is an excellent dish of roasted cauliflower with currants and pine nuts, another of smoky eggplant on toast, with an herb salad dressed in a vivid citrus vinaigrette."
,"A honeydew and cantaloupe gazpacho with almond brittle and a jicama-mint relish sounds preposterous. But Ms. Admony\u2019s clever use of spice and heat to counter the fruit makes it a kind of summertime miracle, a soup you might want to eat for breakfast. (Or for that matter drink in the Nantucket high-summer style, cut through with vodka, on a Wednesday afternoon.)"
,"Main courses can hardly compete against the starters and shareable plates. A fettuccine with tomato butter, zucchini, eggplant, sage and roasted garlic tastes studied and drab, redolent of long shifts at the food co-op, a vegetarian mess. Lamb cooked three ways, with sunchoke pur\u00E9e and a Persian lime sauce, is perhaps two ways too many, though the soft sausage and chard-wrapped loin can do little to diminish the excellence of the roasted chop."
,"And if slices of spice-crusted skirt steak are also wonderful, alongside a crisp and flavorful cumin slaw, there is still a thatch of gummy roasted sweet potatoes beside them, an underminer defined. (There are some roasted potatoes dusted with za\u2019atar available on the menu of shared plates, accompanied by garlic aioli, that are a far better mate for the beef.)"
,"Better is a grilled branzino with asparagus, fennel and a citrusy salad, the fish served with a lemon-spiked dill sauce. Beautifully cooked, and firm and flavorful on the bone, it helps explain the enormous popularity of this farmed European sea bass, a taste of the Mediterranean recaptured by science."
,"The restaurant\u2019s best dish, however, is chicken under a brick: a sweet take on the classic preparation in which a half bird gets the squish treatment in a pan full of oil, its skin turning evenly brown and crunchy as its interior goes first pink and then juicy white."
,"Served as it is here, with Israeli couscous, some dried apricots and soft leeks, and a small bowl of garlicky gremolata, it stands as one of the better chicken dishes found within the confines of Manhattan, and a league leader of the 10012 ZIP. It is a calling card for a casual, take-your-parents-or-a-date restaurant in a neighborhood that hovers just on the edges of chic. In cooking it, Ms. Admony shows herself to be a boss in full - 100 percent baal habayit."

,"152 West 52nd Street, Midtown; (212) 265-9700, baramericain.com."
,"Monday night in Midtown, Broadway dark and tourists scarce, and a couple walks into Bar Americain to take the measure of the place five years into its run. This is not hard duty."
,"There are people in the bar sharing shrimp and glasses of Champagne, clinking glasses as if on a ship bound for Le Havre. There are office parties celebrating around the large round tables by the open kitchen, a few setups of in-laws and marrieds, some dudes in Brooks suits getting serious about rib-eyes and hash browns. It is festive in the restaurant, bubbling along well north of subdued, the sort of place where everyone is always laughing."
,"Bobby Flay opened Bar Americain in 2005, with Laurence Kretchmer. Neither man was present this evening, but it was no drag on the proceedings."
,"There were seafood cocktails to start, a tray of them, rich and plentiful: shrimp with tomatillo; fat crab meat with coconut; sweet lobster with slick avocado($25). These do much to illustrate the particularly American style of Mr. Flay\u2019s cooking, which generally matches heat with sweet, rather than sour. They were gone in a minute."
,"Soft grits with Gulf shrimp ($15) came next, salty with bacon and bitten by garlic, and a red-pepper crab cake with red cabbage slaw ($19). There was a fine apple salad with blue cheese, baby spinach, toasted pecans and a spicy orange vinaigrette ($11)."
,"Lamb chops ($34) replaced the salad then, with mustard barbecue sauce and a corn-and-collards tart, alongside a fat, bloody rib-eye ($39), thick-crusted in spices and served alongside the restaurant\u2019s excellent steak sauce with a woodpile of French fries, and a side dish of cauliflower and goat-cheese gratin to share."
,"Bar Americain is still quite on top of its game."

"MUCH of what you need to know about the direction of fine dining these days is distilled in Bar Boulud, where one of the most accomplished French traditionalists on this side of the Atlantic stages a production whose weakest facet is the conventional three-course dinner."
,"It\u2019s not just white tablecloths that have fallen by the wayside at Bar Boulud, which extends the chef Daniel Boulud\u2019s trajectory toward ever-more-casual restaurants, mirroring the culture around him. Gone, too, is the notion that sitting at a proper table and ordering a proper sequence of dishes is the way you want to eat."
,"You can certainly take that route, which in fact has rewards enough for anyone who does elect it. But unlike Mr. Boulud\u2019s other New York restaurants - Daniel, Caf\u00E9 Boulud and DB Bistro Moderne, in their order of birth and descending degrees of formality - Bar Boulud doesn\u2019t press that path on you."
,"Many of its roughly 100 seats are stools at a high, long counter or chairs at a circular communal table. The fraction of menu real estate claimed by entrees is only about a quarter. And the restaurant\u2019s twin emphases are its terrific wine list and formidable selection of charcuterie."
,"Bar Boulud is a terrine machine, a p\u00E2t\u00E9-a-palooza, dedicated to the proposition that discerning New Yorkers aren\u2019t getting nearly enough concentrated, sculptured, gelatinous animal fat, at least not of a superior caliber."
,"I\u2019ll buy that, and I\u2019ll buy it on the basis of the restaurant\u2019s smooth p\u00E2t\u00E9 grand-m\u00E8re (chicken liver, pork, Cognac) and coarse p\u00E2t\u00E9 grand-p\u00E8re (foie gras, pork, port), both of which are such pure joy to eat - on their own, on toasted bread, with mustard, without - that they sent me on a search across the menu not only for close relatives but also for distant cousins. I was ready to ingest the entire extended family."
,"The charcuterie is the work of a Frenchman named Sylvain Gasdon, who is a prot\u00E9g\u00E9 of a Frenchman named Gilles Verot, who is to head cheese what Yves Saint Laurent is to the tuxedo jacket."
,"Bar Boulud\u2019s salty, meaty head-cheese terrine, as it happens, stands out, though it has fierce competition from a terrine of lamb leg with eggplant, sweet potato and north African spices, and from a beef-cheek terrine with onion confit and pistachio. That\u2019s not to mention the \"tourte de canard,\" which layers figs, foie gras, duck breast and a duck jelly within a pastry crust."
,"There\u2019s also cooked ham, cured ham and sausages, including a boudin blanc, its center as soft as foam, that\u2019s tucked into a bed of truffle-flecked mashed potatoes."
,"From all of these you can assemble an oversize snack or undersize meal, to be rounded out with wine from a list that\u2019s a knockout in terms of its tight focus, its enterprising selections, its elegant organization and its price range."
,"Most of the wines are from Burgundy and the Rhone. Most of the ones that aren\u2019t use Burgundy or Rhone varietals. You can find appealing bottles for under $50, and if you raise the ceiling to $80, you\u2019re swimming in choices. Ask one of the sommeliers to point you in the right direction. They make solid - sometimes even bold - recommendations."
,"In fact wine lovers on a budget have cause right now to rejoice, because both Bar Boulud and Adour Alain Ducasse, which recently opened in the St. Regis Hotel, keep smaller spenders in mind, at least when it comes to the pricing of full bottles."
,"Bar Boulud\u2019s devotion to wine is reflected in the design of the restaurant, situated just across Broadway from Lincoln Center and ready to pick off members of the artsy herd stampeding into and out of performances."
,"The tunnel-shape room - much longer than it is broad, with an arched ceiling - evokes a wine cellar. On one wall, above honey-colored wood booths (the most comfortable perches), hang framed crimson blots that represent wine stains. They look as much like forensic evidence as like art: \"C.S.I.: Beaujolais.\""
,"And they reflect some physical oddities that don\u2019t serve diners well. For instance there\u2019s no real bar, since the long counter is set aside for eating. If you\u2019re waiting for a seat, you\u2019re left to compete for standing rights at one of four tiny, chest-high tables against the all-glass front facing Broadway, and you can easily feel as if you\u2019re on the sidewalk itself."
,"Servers and diners travel a single artery running the length of the restaurant, and serious traffic quickly develops. It\u2019s not the most peaceful backdrop."
,"The prices to some degree reflect the hubbub, the informality. A rich, brightly seasoned bisque with butternut squash, mussels and saffron was $11, while all but one of the entrees on a recent menu were under $30."
,"That\u2019s a clue to the limited ambitions that Mr. Boulud and his executive chef, Damian Sansonetti, have for the dishes beyond the charcuterie, and that\u2019s the context in which their efforts and output should be evaluated."
,"Sure, there\u2019s little wow from the kitchen, which turns out treatments of salmon, sea bass and roasted chicken that, while not quite losers, are definitely snoozers."
,"But I was delighted to find chicken livers in my fris\u00E9e aux lardons, making the fris\u00E9e\u2019s real purpose - as gluttony\u2019s camouflage - all the more transparent. I was smitten with the coq au vin, in which I encountered more bacon, along with a bevy of mushrooms."
,"I was blown away by a side of spinach - and that\u2019s a statement I never imagined making - because it was sort of creamed, sort of not and, in its irresolution, sort of magnificent."
,"And I relished a chocolate and coffee tart, which was more intense, although less flamboyant, than a floating island also among the desserts."
,"All of that was fare I sampled in the evening. I actually prefer Bar Boulud during the day, when it serves an amazing Croque Monsieur and a fantastic Croque Madame, so cheesy and luscious they seem to be experiencing delusions of quiche grandeur."
,"Daniel Boulud finding more glory in lunchtime sandwiches than in dinnertime lamb stew? It\u2019s a new era, and Bar Boulud belongs to it."

"text": [
"HERE now is a new Italian restaurant of the Manhattan old school, built for socialites and those who finance them, staffed by handsome, rakish men with huge wristwatches. It\u2019s the sort of place where in the movie, based on a novel as yet unwritten by Dana Vachon, you might cast Anne Hathaway as the lead and Diane Keaton as her mom. You\u2019re welcome, too. For all this, Casa Lever is a deeply likable restaurant. It\u2019s very New York."
,"The setting is International, on the ground floor of Lever House, on Park Avenue in that gulch of skyscrapers north of Grand Central Terminal. Lever House was designed by Gordon Bunshaft. It was among the first curtain-wall buildings in New York, a triumph of glass volume over concrete mass, pure balance over specious symmetry. It\u2019s the sort of building that makes you stand up straight."
,"In 2003, Lever House restaurant opened in the space, all cold certainty that the Four Seasons was coming to an end, that there was room for a new power restaurant in Midtown. That turned out not to be the case. Lever House the restaurant closed in spring 2009. Gherardo Guarducci and Dimitri Pauli, the dapper pair behind the Sant Ambroeus mini-chain, took over the room and opened Casa Lever in October with a Milanese-ish menu from Mario Danieli, their hard-working chef."
,"They\u2019ve made the restaurant warmer. Lever House\u2019s spaceship vibe has been highlighted with wood trim, chandeliers, little red tables up front, soft carpets beneath the feet. There is a trove of Warhol prints on the wall, silk-screened reminders of Studio 54. These belong to the building, which in turn belongs to the collector and real estate burgher Aby Rosen."
,"Wine racks between the honeycomb booths along the room\u2019s western side refract light into a feeling of conviviality. The art to the east puts even arrivistes directly at the center of a particular kind of Manhattan scene. There is a lot of cashmere and silk at Casa Lever, plenty of crazy wealth. (That\u2019s Mr. Rosen over there now!) But it\u2019s still fun in Spence-Chapin thrift-shop merino, in a Housing Works frock."
,"The service is appealing, comic-opera stuff. And the food, while basic, is often quite good. The spirit of Sant Ambroeus, a restaurant born in Milan in 1936 and mother to the society rooms in the Village, on the Upper East Side and Main Street in Southampton, has never been more serene."
,"Vitello tonnato, the classic summery antipasto of chilled sliced veal served alongside what amounts to a deep cloud of tuna-infused mayonnaise, with a few fried capers strewn about for salty crunch, is here offered as advertised, no more. That is right for the room and its aesthetic: silky tuna sauce and thin folds of veal, just as the grandmothers made, unchanged by time or fashion."
,"A carpaccio of beef with a small tangle of wild mushrooms and delicate Parmesan chips is likewise flavorful, likewise welcome, as are thinly sliced artichokes with soft baby arugula swaddled in bracing lemon, with more of those cheese chips. Micro-greens, those biosphere wonders too easily overcome by dressing, here stand up to little croutons and welcome a soft-poached egg, if not crisped prosciutto in the role of bacon or pancetta."
,"Is an appetizer of seared scallops with white asparagus and black truffle a good use of $18? That\u2019s a question to wrestle, and there\u2019s no correct answer. It\u2019s the culinary equivalent of wondering whether Ferragamo shoes are worth the scratch. If they are to you, they are. The scallops are certainly well cooked."
,"In another direction there are the now-requisite raw-bar offerings of crudi. Of these, there is a shockingly flavorful mackerel plate, with lemon confit, slightly pickled red onion and smoked salt, the combination of which so heightens the flavor of the fish as to amaze. A simple dish of yellowtail tuna, pomegranate seeds and lime might be better consumed on a boat somewhere, with the fish still half butchered on the stern, but even still: it\u2019s not unfresh. And there is a delicious and deeply attractive plate of king crab, sea urchin, pickled jalape\u00F1o and avocado. As young Mr. Ripley and Dickie Greenleaf discovered in San Remo, it can be tough to share."
,"Pastas are generally simple, with a few change-ups thrown into the mix, probably for market flair. These, along with a muddy stuffed chicken, are the missteps on the menu. Amatriciana, for instance, is another classic of Italian cuisine, a sauce traditionally made of guanciale, or jowl bacon, with pecorino and tomato. Here it\u2019s rendered with tuna, and served with a fat sort of rigatoni from Gragnano. It\u2019s interesting, not great. Paccheri served with a red snapper ragout, cherry tomatoes and baby artichokes is less interesting, and not good."
,"But ravioli with sausage and burrata, draped in a fennel pur\u00E9e, is wonderful: creamy with a slight bite. There is a fine saffron risotto most notable for the pile of pulled veal that sits atop it, rich and salty, thick with fat. And spaghetti with little Manila clams and fresh tomatoes is a classic of the form."
,"A sensible person might make a meal out of the above and avoid the high prices of Casa Lever\u2019s meat and fish courses. These are meant to sate those who don\u2019t look at menu prices. But there are splurges worth the price: veal Milanese, for instance, pounded wide and fried with a rare excellence. Also terrific lamb chops with polenta and dark, rustic mushrooms strewn alongside them."
,"The restaurant\u2019s bone-in New York strip is roughly the size of a hardcover Italian-English dictionary. It\u2019s cooked crusty and rich, as if for an audition at Peter Luger. It\u2019s excellent. So too is the Dover sole, with a Dijon sauce, vacationing from France and perfect alongside a glass of fragrant Ciallabianco, from Ronchi di Cialla in Friuli."
,"Desserts are worthy of Sant Ambroeus: marvelous sorbetti and towering gianduja of hazelnut and chocolate; truffles of chocolate sorbet, with orange gel\u00E9e; even just a serving of cut fruit, designed for ladies who continue to lunch."
,"None of the food at Casa Lever is particularly groundbreaking. It owes little to the recent trend toward Italian cooking of the sort found at Marea or Del Posto, all towering ambition and crazy imagination. That\u2019s all right. People used to say the thing about Italian cuisine was that it is mostly just excellent ingredients served plain on a plate, without much interpretation. Sometimes that\u2019s worth recalling over just such a meal, in a beautiful room."

"text": [
"TOM COLICCHIO came out of the kitchen at Colicchio & Sons the other night wearing a short-sleeved dishwasher\u2019s shirt and a white apron. His black clogs were scuffed beneath his jeans, and there were burn marks on his forearms. He appeared tired, his angry eyes more sunken than usual."
,"He had been in Los Angeles earlier in the week, running a big dinner for the Oscars. He had been down in Dallas before that, for a charity dinner for, among others, Jay-Z and LeBron James. Mr. Colicchio has Craft restaurants in both cities, as well as others in Atlanta, San Francisco, Las Vegas and at Foxwoods in Connecticut. He had been in Washington, too, where he will film the next season of \"Top Chef,\" the cooking competition on Bravo for which he is chief judge. It draws something on the order of three million viewers a week."
,"Mr. Colicchio is a celebrity. He is also a businessman with varied and complicated interests in cities across the United States."
,"But he is by temperament and deportment a cook. And at Colicchio & Sons he is running his kitchen at a level that New Yorkers have not been able to experience since his days at the helm of Gramercy Tavern, the restaurant he opened with Danny Meyer in 1994. For the moment, anyway, Mr. Colicchio\u2019s is the must-try New York menu. His restaurant isn\u2019t perfect. But it is exciting. And the food is terrifically good."
,"Order the tasting menu: $125. (Expensive, yes, but still cheaper than orchestra seats for \"The Nose,\" or a facial at Bliss.) Currently it begins with a single roasted scallop placed beside an equal measure of silken foie-gras terrine. Pale turnips turned in honey, and peppery, chicory-like puntarelle separate the species. They elevate what might be a menu clich\u00E9 into something fantastic."
,"Much more follows, an intricate dance to flavor. A cone of squid arrives stuffed with cavalo nero, a kind of black cabbage, over an ebony-ink risotto that itself emerges from a fiery chunked tomato sauce. A stroke of dark sauce - roasted cacao nibs blended into verjus - runs a bass line under the salt and sweet, heightening both."
,"Then lobster, a slash of red and white claw meat in a lobster bordelaise so deeply flavored as to recall both veal stock and opium smoke, with cabbage to bind them together. And sturgeon, a rectangle of meat the color of ivory, with a sauce of reduced grape must and a grape-pumpkin marmalade. It\u2019s a mad hatter\u2019s dish, cooking out of Lewis Carroll."
,"Red squab is next, the tiny bird lacquered and crisp, scented with vadouvan, the French-ish curry powder that made its big-market debut on \"Top Chef\" a few years ago. It tastes of funky sophistication, illicit rides in late-night cabs. And last, before a dessert round of orange-scented cannoli and a phenomenal mango tatin from Stephen Collucci, the restaurant\u2019s fearsomely talented pastry chef, comes a perfectly roasted piece of lamb loin. It\u2019s served with nettles, green and puckered chickpeas and a caramelized yogurt with luxurious tang. This is low-whistle-and-chuckles food."
,"At Craft, Mr. Colicchio\u2019s flagship restaurant on 19th Street, there is no caramelized yogurt, no grape-pumpkin marmalade. Even at Tom: Tuesday Dinner, the supper club he ran there for a time, the composed plates did not exhibit the sophistication currently on offer at Colicchio & Sons."
,"\"As much as I love what I do at Craft,\" Mr. Colicchio told New York magazine in December, \"I don\u2019t want to be known for putting a piece of fish on the plate with olive oil and salt and pepper.\""
,"And so he has gone in an opposite direction. There are elements of French technique to the cooking here, as well as an appreciable Italian devotion to ingredients. There are Indian flavors, and central European ones; there are nods also at Spain, at the Greenmarket, at North Africa. The result is a menu with an aesthetic that is entirely American. It appropriates all that has come to it, without apology."
,"There is an astonishing array of beer available to match this food, most of it well suited to it; a varied and excellent wine list has prices that, unlike Craft\u2019s, do not provoke winces."
,"Whatever you\u2019re drinking, it\u2019s hard to go wrong with an appetizer of butter-poached oysters, off the regular menu. These are served in a wide bowl with celery root cooked and cut into a perfect rendition of tagliatelle pasta, with a large dab of American caviar for seasoning."
,"The dish is spooky perfection, crazy-making in its clean simplicity, its slinky richness. Butter traces run into oyster liquor, and the amalgamation swirls forward over the sweetness of a vegetable that acts as a starch, and carries the salty pop of the fish eggs carefully toward the tongue."
,"Also nice: an addictive sea urchin and crab fondue; a hugely fat roasted sweetbread with honey-napped onions and a bacon-sherry vinaigrette; and agnolotti stuffed with a mash of white beans, with chorizo, pork belly and octopus, a buddy-and-sidekick film that should do well at the box office."
,"For entrees, there is a wide wrist of monkfish, wrapped in pancetta and cooked crisp, atop braised red cabbage that\u2019s been dressed in black-truffle vinaigrette. The combination of flavors - sweet again, and salty, with a bite of acid - cross-references the varied textures like a math problem, or an Escher print."
,"Chicken pot-au-feu is hardly stewish beneath its crisp sheet of skin and fat cuts of black truffle, but it maintains the Escoffier standard while stepping into the modern age; a veal breast with tripe, trumpet royal mushrooms and a sweet cousin of baby broccoli, spigarello, explodes it for the same purpose. There is excellent striped bass with chopped razor clams and pea shoots, the sort of meal where you want a fork, a spoon and a few napkins, and a precisely Frenched little rack of rabbit, with braised fennel and olives. This last is dollhouse cuisine, not bad, if a little creepy."
,"About the only misses are a perfectly cooked and defiantly under-seasoned fist of sirloin that is no match for the salsify, bacon and black garlic that come with it, and, for the same reason, a braised loup de mer with pork trotter and shallots cooked sweet and sour."
,"Colicchio & Sons occupies the space that used to be Craftsteak, which Mr. Colicchio opened in 2006. Versions of that restaurant have done well in casino towns. But in Manhattan, the conceit started and stalled, then gained traction only to drive into the teeth of a new, diminished economy. Mr. Colicchio closed it right before Christmas last year."
,"Colicchio & Sons came less than a month later. Some of the staff has remained (\"Craftsteak, good afternoon!\"). But a lot of testosterone has been drained off, and a combination of flowers and a Grateful Deadish soundtrack do much to counter the boom-era feel of the restaurant\u2019s towering ceilings and soft leather seats. It\u2019s not precisely comfortable, but it\u2019s close."
,"This is true especially at lunch, up in the Tap Room, where there\u2019s a big rug in front of the bar and a menu that runs to pizzas and sandwiches and low-caliber versions of some of the dinner meals. An open-face Dagwood taken there at noon - grilled toast and pulled pork piled high with sauerkraut with a run of Fontina - is a perfect introduction to a long walk on the High Line and an argument for blowing off the afternoon\u2019s work besides."
,"Mr. Colicchio stands by the pizza oven up front, his arms crossed, his bald head gleaming in the heat. He\u2019s talking low to a cook, forceful already, a couple of hours into a doubleheader day, customers who recognize him from billboards streaming past, whispering as if he were Derek Jeter at batting practice."
,"You think celebrity is easy? Colicchio & Sons says: not if you\u2019re ambitious."

"GREAT restaurants may start out that way. But an extraordinary restaurant generally develops only over time, the product of prolonged artistic risk and managerial attention. An extraordinary restaurant uses the threat of failure first as a spur to improvement, then as a vision of unimaginable calamity. An extraordinary restaurant can transcend the identity of its owners or chef or concept."
,"And of course an extraordinary restaurant serves food that leads to gasps and laughter, to serious discussion and demands for more of that, please, now. The point of fine dining is intense pleasure. For the customer, at any rate, an extraordinary restaurant should never be work."
,"Consider Del Posto, which opened in 2005 on a wind-swept corner of that grim Manhattan neighborhood that is neither Chelsea nor the meatpacking district, in the shadows below what is now the High Line park. The restaurant\u2019s owners, Joseph Bastianich, Lidia Bastianich and Mario Batali, and its chef, Mark Ladner, envisioned a temple to Italian cooking to match any ever built to honor a European cuisine in New York, a 24,000-square-foot palazzo of mahogany and marble devoted entirely to the pleasures of Italian food and customer satisfaction."
,"Five years later Del Posto is that and more, a place to sit in luxury and drink Barolo, while eating food that bewilders and thrills - an abalone carpaccio to start your meal, perhaps, and absolutely a celery sorbetto to end it, as well-played Gershwin and Kern tinkle in the background."
,"Del Posto\u2019s is a pleasure that lasts, offering memories of flavors that may return later in a dream: a tiny cup of spiced gazpacho, say, rimmed with a salty dust of dried capers; or a plate of the square-cut whole-wheat pasta known as tonarelli, with fiery little chickpeas, fried rosemary and bonito flakes in place of the more-traditional bottarga; perhaps a nectarine cooked into slow and amazing submission, with a savory grilled lemon cake and intense basil gelato. And, oh, that wine!"
,"The road to the restaurant\u2019s success was bumpy. It was not short. There was no precedent for Del Posto in Manhattan, no polished-brass, soft-carpeted Italian restaurant that dared to out-French the French in service, formalizing a simple cuisine, while at the same time urging casual excess on its customers. (Del Posto translates, literally, to \"of the place.\" You will not find its like in Venice or Berlin, Los Angeles or Miami.)"
,"Early on, however, the restaurant\u2019s service seemed strained, almost theatrical. (Now it is warm and practiced: French-trained and Italian-accented, which is to say American.) Some disliked the room, with its central staircase leading to undulating balconies, its lobbyish feel. (Some still feel this way.) Others loathed the piano, thought it suburban and twee. (The playing improved, the repertory deepened.)"
,"Meanwhile, fine dining of the sort exemplified by Del Posto began to suffer in the marketplace, as the food-obsessed turned their attention from white tablecloths to wooden tabletops, from toques to full-sleeve tattoos, from ties and cocktail dresses to T-shirts and A.P.C. jeans."
,"There have never been complaints about Del Posto\u2019s huge and deeply comprehensive wine collection, with its whale-bait Piedmontese nebbiolos and surprising values from up and down the peninsula. But there was a period there when the desserts were lame. The service in the dining room improved then faltered. In 2009, the faceless inspectors of the Michelin guide stripped the restaurant of a star."
,"For roughly the last year, however, under the close guidance of Mr. Ladner, who was the Puckish brain behind Lupa, a trattoria in the West Village also owned in part by Mr. Batali and Mr. Bastianich, Del Posto\u2019s kitchen has been operating at the very highest level. The restaurant\u2019s less expensive cafe section, near the bar, was removed, along with a number of tables on the balcony. With the help of a brilliant new pastry chef, Brooks Headley, and a revitalized and enthusiastic service staff of Italian nationals and veterans of the Batali-Bastianich empire, Del Posto is now among the very best restaurants in New York City."
,"What was designated a three-star restaurant by Frank Bruni in this newspaper in 2006 has become a four-star one. It is the first Italian restaurant to receive a four-star ranking in The Times since Parioli Romanissimo, reviewed by John Canaday in 1974."
,"Dinner is served in three formats, all of which highlight Mr. Ladner\u2019s careful interpretation of Italian cuisine, in which brilliant technique renders incredible ingredients as art. Diners may simply order off the menu, as at the corner bistro. There is a five-course option for $95, in which each diner picks an antipasto, a main course and a dessert, and the table shares two pasta preparations in the middle. And there is a seven-course menu tradizionale for $125, in which the table is introduced to the length and breadth of Italian cuisine, from Sicily north to the Alto Adige."
,"All deliver pleasures, from a simple, elegant Kindai tuna belly simmered in olive oil on the menu tradizionale to a regular-menu order of lamb cooked in the Roman style, salty and rich, with a tangy lemon yogurt and cloud-light Swiss chard rag\u00F9. But among New Yorkers used to sharing their bounty, the deepest joy may reside in a fiddle to the five-course option, one that throws a third pasta preparation into the middle of the meal."
,"Mr. Ladner\u2019s pastas are insanely good. After a wintry appetizer of warm, soft cotechino in a lentil vinaigrette, his spaghetti with Dungeness crab, sliced jalape\u00F1o and minced scallion arrives like the sun. It is a dish that speaks directly to Mr. Ladner\u2019s genius, to a view of Italian cooking that allows for both jalape\u00F1o and Dungeness crab. His cooking is not about recreating Italy on a luxe scale so much as it is about recreating the Italian spirit on the grandest scale imaginable."
,"Spinach garganelli, for instance, might follow a sweet lobster salad with intense little tomatoes and a celery crunch, the pasta tubes glistening beneath a Bolognese sauce of incredible delicacy, the result of an all-day preparation that recalls more than anything else monkish devotion to flavor and beauty. It is the illuminated manuscript of cooking."
,"And a small bowl of anellini, robiola-stuffed pasta rounds the shape of World Series rings, comes with a black-truffle sauce that tastes of earned wealth and deep satisfaction. But you eat the dish with your fingers. It feels like skinny-dipping at the Lido, and is as enjoyable."
,"Main dishes are luxurious and well suited to occasion dining. For the celebration of business deals, for instance, there is an enormous rib-eye, cooked to rosy perfection beneath a dusting of salt and pepper, with a pile of fried potatoes, a tangle of Italian arugula and dots of tomato raisins that are worth almost literally their weight in gold. (The dish is $130 \u00E0 la carte.)"
,"Mr. Ladner offers a complicated plate of grilled pork and head cheese with peas and mint, with a light drizzle of the Neapolitan wine known as Lacryma Christi (the Tears of Christ), and a simple one of salmon beneath a wheat dressing made from simmering pasta not for minutes but (once more!) for hours, then reducing the result almost to syrup. He rolls veal loin in pulverized hardwood charcoal before slow-roasting it, then serves the result with luscious hand-ground polenta and a sticky, intense sauce made from osso buco. This last is wildly flavorful - a bass line for baby beef, an alimentary subwoofer."
,"Mr. Headley\u2019s desserts follow dinner in the manner of a rondo that extends the pleasures of the meal far into the night - and often dangerously deep into the restaurant\u2019s superb list of amari and grappas."
,"Mr. Headley was a punk-rock drummer who came to professional cooking late, and who bears precisely none of the marks of a new-century New York pastry chef. There is no architecture to his work, no foam. There is instead deep respect for, among other things, vegetable sugars, and for the accidents of art. (For birthdays and other celebrations, he creates a dessert tree by pouring molten chocolate into an ice bath. The result is three-dimensional Pollock.)"
,"And so there are sfera di caprino, little goat-cheesecake balls rolled in salty olive oil and bread crumbs, accompanied by celery and fig agrodolce, with celery sorbetto. There is butterscotch semifreddo, not at all sweet, and a sour orange sauce made with rehydrated dried cantaloupe and cookie crumbs. And, to finish: a cheese-grating box filled with candies high in acid, dusted in salt, as amazing and wonderful as inspiration itself."
,"All that is missing from Del Posto at the moment are the New Yorkers who came early and then stayed away. The room fills late now with business travelers and visiting rock bands. But all are welcome. It is time to get a reservation and tell everyone you knew this would happen all along."

"IT\u2019S a common assumption that most ambitious restaurants improve with age, working out their kinks, controlling their jitters, tempering the vanity that breeds bad judgment."
,"Common, but not really correct anymore. These days - when the ramp-up to a restaurant\u2019s opening is endless, the storm of bloggers dissecting its baby steps is boundless and its frenzied first months can make or break it - it often shows the most discipline and highest standards at the start. After that, there is drift, to different degrees, at different velocities. What the restaurant gains in maturity it loses in pure drive."
,"As for the elite club of truly extraordinary restaurants, they don\u2019t so much raise the level of their games as maintain it (which is blessing and pleasure enough). Jean Georges and Per Se are magnificent now, but they were magnificent then, too. While there\u2019s magic in a meal at either, there isn\u2019t really any sense of revelation."
,"That\u2019s why my visits to Eleven Madison Park over the last five years have, in arc and aggregate, given me such particular joy. I watched a distinguished restaurant get better, even though it already seemed popular enough to survive just the way it was. Then I watched an improved, excellent restaurant, which I elevated to three stars from two in early 2007, make yet another unnecessary advance."
,"I fell in love gradually, not all at once. The experience had a sweetness all its own."
,"Eleven Madison Park, which opened in 1998, now ranks among the most alluring and impressive restaurants in New York. It has reached this pinnacle because its principal owner, the indefatigable Danny Meyer, made a key move in 2006, bringing aboard the chef Daniel Humm, and because together they decided - out of pride, it seems to me, more than any commercial calculation - that this restaurant could and should shine as brightly as any other."
,"It already had the setting: that theatrically tall, marble and nickel-walled hall in the old Metropolitan Life Building, with grand windows onto the verdure of Madison Square Park. It already had a deep, broad wine list."
,"It just needed a bit more polish in its service and a lot more sparkle in its food. Over the last three and a half years, it has received precisely that, in measures that increased steadily since the arrival of Mr. Humm (and, soon after him, a new general manager, Will Guidara, and a new wine director, John Ragan, who has wisely supplemented familiar treasures from France with less familiar ones from other countries)."
,"Mr. Humm\u2019s French-grounded cooking, which bridges the classically saucy decadence of the past and the progressive derring-do of a new generation, drew notice from the get-go. He hadn\u2019t been in place long before the city\u2019s gluttons were atwitter (in the old-fashioned sense) about his way with suckling pig. He served it as a dense, tender brick of confit below the most crisply fatty sheet of crackling imaginable."
,"But instead of resting on his suckling laurels, he took this wrinkle of his reputation and ran with it, developing a tasting menu with five consecutive courses of suckling pig, including belly cooked sous vide and a roasted rack of tiny, exquisite chops. I sampled this last month, and it was superb."
,"The menu allows you to chart paths of varying lengths, from three standard courses, each of which you choose, to a \"gourmand\" experience of 11 unspecified courses that Mr. Humm selects for you. But even the briefest route includes numerous detours, because he has a particular enthusiasm for succinct, intense add-ons to be experienced before or between the principal dishes."
,"For example, every dinner begins with a five-piece row of single-bite amuse bouches, one with foie gras, another with salmon and another with sweetbreads nestled in a crunchy cornet."
,"Some of his best work comes in small packages, like a cup of \"sea urchin cappuccino\" that was presented as a little surprise during a meal whose climax would be a flawlessly cooked blue foot chicken for two with a brioche, foie gras and truffle butter stuffing under the glistening skin."
,"The cappuccino\u2019s inclusion of cauliflower mousse below a peekytoe crab salad, sea urchin roe and a sea urchin foam made with cream and Cognac seemed to allude to (and perhaps borrowed from) a famous Jo&#235;l Robuchon dish of cauliflower cream, lobster and sea urchin."
,"But Mr. Humm\u2019s version was an altogether frothier and more indulgent affair, and whenever it threatened to become too much, a tart, astringent note flickered, reining everything in. The difference between good and great cooking of this kind is often knowing where the creamy, buttery, unctuous tipping point is - and stopping just shy of it. Mr. Humm does that expertly."
,"Like so many practitioners of contemporary French cooking, he favors foams, bisques, gel\u00E9es and such: in place of the sea urchin cappuccino one night was a smoked sturgeon sabayon, served in an eggshell."
,"But Mr. Humm is mindful of the need for some textural contrast - some crunch. So a slow-poached egg with a brown butter hollandaise and a Parmesan foam boasted not only crisp, beautiful asparagus but also a Parmesan tuile. Its salty kick was another reason to have it around."
,"Some chefs and restaurants do better with meat than with fish, or vice versa, but that\u2019s not the case here. I\u2019m crazy for the lavender honey-glazed duck for two, but I\u2019m just as crazy for the restaurant\u2019s changing lobster dishes - one of the best has curried granola - and for its reliably moist, snowy halibut."
,"I\u2019m crazier still for the Hawaiian prawn roulade, an appetizer that tastes like a repurposed California roll with all of the glory and none of the gunk. Poached prawns are dressed with cr\u00E8me fra&#238;che, diced green apple and lime juice and then molded into a thin horizontal column surfaced with thinly sliced, vivid avocado."
,"Mr. Humm\u2019s judicious flirtations with molecular gastronomy have intensified over the years, to exciting effect. One tomato salad comprised liquid spheres - those quivering, explosive orbs made famous by the Spanish wizard Ferran Adri\u00E0 - of white buffalo mozzarella and red tomato. Another floated a fleecy tomato \"cloud\" (tomato water whipped with gelatin) over a patchwork of red and yellow cherry tomatoes."
,"Mr. Humm supervises the sweets in addition to what precedes them, and with most he finds the right middle ground between hyper-imaginative artistry and molten chocolate pandering. Accessorizing the gooey chocolate centerpiece of one dessert with both caramel popcorn and a popcorn-flavored ice cream did that trick nicely."
,"The $88 price of three courses plus all the little extras makes Eleven Madison Park more affordable than, for example, Le Bernardin or Daniel, and is a major reason I send people there more often."
,"But I also send them because the large scale and hubbub of the room, connected to a lively bar area whose merriment spills into it, makes it seem less of a rapt, cinching commitment. Eleven Madison Park provides much of the ceremony and pampering associated with fine dining at its most traditional in a way that\u2019s louder, looser and more in sync with most diners\u2019 temperaments."
,"By design it\u2019s not quite as approachable as Gramercy Tavern or Union Square Cafe, Mr. Meyer\u2019s more widely beloved mainstays. But with Mr. Humm, 32, at the helm, young and hungry and undistracted by the kind of empire that such elders as Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Daniel Boulud have created, it shimmers in a way that none of Mr. Meyer\u2019s many terrific restaurants ever have. That\u2019s saying a great deal, but no less than Eleven Madison has earned."

"FATTY \u2019CUE, Zakary Pelaccio\u2019s funky new barbecue joint on South Sixth Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, looks like a biker bar for the kind of bikers who don\u2019t ride Harleys in leathers and boots, but stripped-down Schwinns in boat shoes and skinny jeans."
,"The entrance sits low and dingy below the sidewalk, next to some stained traffic cones. It\u2019s dark and shouty inside, with spartan dining rooms spread out over three small floors. These are all faintly scented with oak smoke, and packed with people in beards or vintage dresses, everyone talking loudly over tiny tables that are not quite sticky, peering at menus in the low light, ripping into their meals."
,"The food is incredibly good. Fatty \u2019Cue is a restaurant worth traveling to visit. To expand on the playbook of awesome, Malaysian-ish cooking on display at the Fatty Crab restaurants in Manhattan, Mr. Pelaccio\u2019s Fatty Crew - with Corwin Kave as executive chef and Andrew Pressler as chef de cuisine - has added to their roster Robbie Richter, the Queens-born pitmaster who helped start Hill Country in 2007. Fatty \u2019Cue offers smoked crabs and smoked lamb ribs, coriander-dusted bacon and pieces of pig. You can eat smoky noodle soups and pickled chilies. There is brisket and bao."
,"That said, it sure would be funny to roll up to the place with a white-shoe lawyer, some actuarial accountant from Tucson or dramaturge from the Upper West Side, anyone who goes to restaurants expecting the small courtesies that make up the usual experience of spending close to $100 for a meal for two people."
,"No reservations are taken, so unless you eat in daylight or draw good luck, there\u2019s going to be a wait for a table, time spent standing at a bar that was crowded when you arrived and will be when you leave. Also, as the waiters will tell you when you do get a seat, the food comes out when the kitchen prepares it, according to the kitchen\u2019s own needs and schedule, which means there is no real structure to the meals. Indeed, the food can arrive at such a rush as to make the service at Big Wong on Mott Street seem like that of Eleven Madison Park."
,"Forewarned is forearmed: Fatty \u2019Cue might be uncomfortable for those who hear more music at Lincoln Center than at Southpaw."
,"So embrace your place. Start with a \"recession special\" cocktail: a shot of rail bourbon, a shot of spicy pickle juice and a tallboy of Pabst. The drink is best consumed in that order, pausing only to thrill to the way that pickle juice refracts the flavors of first the whiskey and then the beer. (After taking a sip or two of the Pabst you may consider the experience complete, and ask the waiter to replace it with something drinkable.)"
,"Then get ready to throw down."
,"The menu at Fatty \u2019Cue comes in two main sections: snacks and specialties. Diversify your holdings in each area, aiming to bring at least a snack and a specialty per person, perhaps more. Dessert is delicious, but is not strictly necessary: fat Tumbador candy bars named for the restaurant and a selection of pies from First Prize, a newish bakery run by Allison Kave, Mr. Kave\u2019s sister."
,"Really, all 10 snacks are worth trying, with the exception perhaps of the cucumber salad, over-dressed in smoked chili and brown-rice vinegar, with toasted sesame seeds. Among the best is a broth created from smoked bones, with galangal and Chinese celery: light and fragrant, slightly spicy. \"A bowl of noodles,\" meanwhile, arrives with scallions and chilies, acidic with lemon juice and young ginger, slicked with \"meat juices\" collected from resting meats. It doesn\u2019t look like much, beneath its dusting of dried, fermented baby shrimp powder. Yeah, well. It is the OxyContin of ramen."
,"And coriander bacon, fatty and rich, is served with steamed yellow-curry custard, fiery and light. The combination is insanely agreeable, particularly if you pair it with an order of Chinatown white-bread toast slathered in fat rendered from every animal in the kitchen: pork mixed with beef mixed with duck mixed with lamb. Master fat: schmaltz for the deeply Reform."
,"Each weekend the crew puts a whole pig in a smoker, then sells it off in pieces, with bao and more yellow curry. If this is available, it\u2019s a must as a main course. So, too, are long, elegant spare ribs, in a sauce made of palm syrup and a smoky fish sauce."
,"Fatty \u2019Cue is pig heaven. (In keeping with the restaurant\u2019s interpretation of kashrut, even the Manila clams come with huge hunks of house-made bacon, in yet more of that bone broth, with curry leaves and a honking undercurrent of fire.)"
,"But for specialties, you\u2019ll want the beef brisket as well, made with way-smoked, meltingly tender American wagyu and served with chili jam, aioli and pickled red onion, with some bone broth and warm steamed bao: deckle deliciousness from psychedelic Texas."
,"There is excellent red-curry-rubbed duck, too, soft and meaty and hot, with sweet pickled daikon. A smoked dorade\u2019s worth asking for, too, with a chili-garlic-lime sauce, if only so that you can tell the waiter you\u2019d like the bones cooked crisp and edible as a second course. These are fine, indeed. (Pass on the seafood sausage, wan and damp.)"
,"And while hand-pulled lamb turns away from Asia to embrace the Mediterranean, with goat yogurt, mint and warm, house-made pita, it still feels of a piece with the rest of the meal: smoky and intense, with a crunchy bark outside its luscious interior."
,"Best of all is smoked-crab laksa, a spicy noodle soup the proper preparation of which can start arguments up and down the Strait of Malacca. It is Chinese by way of Malaysia. At Fatty \u2019Cue, it has been sent to school along the Chesapeake Bay: a funky, deeply smoky crab broth that packs heat like an oven door, with cold-smoked lump crab meat, tiny anchovies, maitake and shiitake mushrooms, a lot of grated daikon, brown-rice vinegar, unrefined palm syrup and soft, thick lai fun noodles."
,"The combination of American barbecue technique and South Asian flavors is brilliant and unsettling. It recalls, almost perfectly, what the Buddhist teacher Chogyam Trungpa called the magic of the present moment. To eat at Fatty Crew\u2019s new restaurant is to experience the very essence of nowness. No one else is cooking like this anywhere."

"TWENTY years ago, when Fifth Avenue in Park Slope could still be called marginal in the pages of The New York Times, Michael Ayoub opened Cucina there, on the corner of Carroll Street. The restaurant was an elegantly casual Italian trattoria that managed to charm both a burgeoning population of young brownstoners with jobs in Manhattan and the neighborhood\u2019s old guard of professional-class Brooklynites."
,"Lawyers from Wall Street and Court Street alike sat side by side at Cucina, eating rigatoni, drinking wine, talking up a borough in ascendance. Bryan Miller, then the newspaper\u2019s restaurant critic, expressed surprise at Cucina\u2019s location, and awarded the place two stars."
,"In the years since, Mr. Ayoub\u2019s fortunes have gone up and down and up. He opened and closed a steakhouse and cigar bar, cater-cornered from Cucina. He shuttered Cucina. He ran a catering business. In 2004, he left Park Slope to open Fornino in Williamsburg, a wood-oven pizzeria that drew praise and crowds for its Naples-style pies."
,"And in May, he returned to the Cucina space to open Fornino Park Slope, an elegantly casual Italian trattoria in two parallel dining rooms filled with dark wood and old photographs of Brooklyn, as well as a great deal of the glass sculpture he creates when he isn\u2019t throwing pizzas or running his business."
,"The restaurant is a fine addition to the borough\u2019s now-sprawling call-for-reservations dining scene. It aspires to no more than what it provides: a comfortable destination for those who live nearby and for those who have come from Bay Ridge or Mill Basin for a nice night out, from Ditmas or Kensington or Sunset Park. It is not a restaurant for gastrotourists. Those who take town cars to dinner in Bushwick or Vinegar Hill are thin on the ground."
,"As was true at Cucina, the menu at Fornino Park Slope is improbably large. There are 17 versions of grilled pizza, and close to a dozen entrees. Eight pastas are offered, and more than a dozen antipasti, salads and side dishes. A modest wine list offers familiar varietals, at good prices. The dessert menu achieves similar goals. (Yes, you should get the tiramis\u00F9.)"
,"Start with a spread of antipasti. Mr. Ayoub makes a strong eggplant caponata, and better-still marinated chickpeas, adorned with Parmesan. He presents a superlative dish of beets with ricotta salata, cool and sweet and salty. He studs a plate of pale white anchovies with pink peppercorns, and grinds up a terrific, ever-so-slightly fiery Tuscan chicken liver spread. His prosciutto - from Salumeria Biellese in Chelsea - is excellent."
,"You can ignore the salads unless the notion of iceberg with cherry tomatoes and a creamy Gorgonzola dressing intrigues, in which case you\u2019ll be pleased until you realize that you can\u2019t follow it with a salty, thick-crusted, rosemary-scented strip steak. Fornino\u2019s grilled meat options are limited to a portion of chewy skirt steak with bitter greens, olives and more of those cherry tomatoes. There ought to be a law."
,"But the rigatoni remains from the original Cucina menu, in its creamy tomato sauce studded with fennel sausage, dairy sweetness covering the acidity of the tomatoes like a blanket. This is welcome. There is also very good crab cappelletti, the stuffed hats of pasta served in a garlicky broth with a delegation of Manila clams, and spaghetti alla chitarra, with crisp guanciale and melting prosciutto, red onion, a slap of chicken broth, pecorino Romano and a soft poached egg."
,"This last - its flavors rich and layered, the pasta cooked beautifully, the egg yolk melding with the chicken broth - is a necessary order for anyone who knows Mr. Ayoub\u2019s work only from the Fornino in Williamsburg, where he can still be spotted on occasional evenings in gleaming chef\u2019s whites, serving textbook pies to the neighborhood ectomorphs who have crowded the room since it was the L Cafe."
,"He isn\u2019t simply a pizza man and never has been. His cod wrapped in prosciutto, served with capers, olives and a scattering of sweet cherry tomatoes, showcases real talent in the preparation of fish, and a nicely cooked duck breast with cherries, spinach, pine nuts and a glaze of white balsamic vinegar shows a sure hand with game as well."
,"In fact, the pizza at Fornino Park Slope may be the restaurant\u2019s weakest suit. Rather than capitalizing on his success with a wood oven, Mr. Ayoub has moved beyond it, and taken up the mantle of grilled pizza, a technique made famous by Al Forno in Providence, R.I., and popularized in New York mostly by the chef Vincent Scotto. (His pies at Gonzo, on 13th Street, were among the best in the city until his sudden death in 2007, at 39.)"
,"\"I\u2019ve already done brick-oven pizza,\" Mr. Ayoub told the Grub Street blog in April."
,"He wanted a challenge. And he got one. The pies at Fornino Park Slope have thin crusts, in some cases almost shatteringly so, and they can lack the purity of flavor that characterizes the wood-oven versions at the Williamsburg location. Sometimes they don\u2019t work at all. A plain margherita pie, for instance, sits flat and crackly on its plate, devoid of yeasty flavor; it felt in the mouth a little like a pizza made with saltines. A version made with clams, crescenza cheese and fior di latte also fell short, and even the liquor released from the clams failed to soften the crust."
,"More successful are the versions in which a fair amount of stuff is piled on top of the pie, and the cheese and fat perhaps protect some part of the dough. The pizza Mr. Ayoub has dedicated to the memory of Mr. Scotto - piled high with Bel Paese, pecorino, fior di latte and ricotta, as well as slices of fiery salami and dabs of roast-pepper aioli - has proved itself to be a marvel of structural integrity, with great texture beneath the creaminess. It is the best on the menu."
,"Fornino Park Slope is a throwback, the sort of restaurant that will appeal mostly to those who still think of Manhattan as \"the city,\" and who rarely cross a river to get to work. Fuggedaboutit, et cetera. It is a restaurant fit for Kings."

"THERE are restaurants with more shimmer, and there are certainly restaurants with more spark. There are restaurants that take bigger chances and stake bolder claims to your attention."
,"But is there a restaurant in this city more beloved than Gramercy Tavern? For nearly 13 years it has held a place in the hearts of New Yorkers and visitors to Manhattan that\u2019s arguably unrivaled. And it has proven that at the end of the day, both literally and figuratively, what most diners want isn\u2019t nerve-jangling sensation or cutting-edge surprise. It\u2019s a kind of unstrained graciousness and unlabored sophistication that Gramercy Tavern has pretty much defined."
,"Diners found that here in the past and can find it here again now, though there was an interval when all wasn\u2019t well, when Gramercy seemed to be coasting, or rather drifting, its service erratic, its cooking off key."
,"Even before the chef Tom Colicchio formally left the restaurant last August, it wasn\u2019t getting the lion\u2019s share of his attention: I had a few forgettable dinners here between mid-2004 and early 2006. Late last year, shortly after Michael Anthony took charge of the kitchen, I had a clumsy, laughable one."
,"The next morning one of my guests sent me an e-mail message: \"I have to ask you - beg you, really - to stop the abomination that is Gramercy Tavern. You have no higher journalistic calling.\""
,"She was right about that meal, wrong about my charge. What I needed to do was keep a watchful but hopeful eye on a restaurant that had earned the benefit of the doubt, and give Mr. Anthony some time."
,"He and Gramercy\u2019s principal owner, Danny Meyer, have clearly been busy. Over the last five months, they have restored a needed discipline to the restaurant, which relies less on swagger than on finesse and draws its strength from ingredients that are carefully selected and sharply reflective of the season. Mr. Anthony came to Gramercy from the Blue Hill restaurants in Manhattan and Westchester County, and the Blue Hill farm-to-table ethos - a more finicky application of values Gramercy already celebrated - has come with him, embodied in a new vegetarian tasting menu."
,"For the most part he cooks with the gentleness of Dan Barber, the chef at Blue Hill, rather than the gusto of Mr. Colicchio. Whether the centerpiece of a dish was fish, bird or mammal, whether it was roasted, poached or smoked, it took as supple a form as possible, and it seldom receded behind grandstanding effects."
,"Pale slices of sturgeon fillet were as silky as rose petals, and the sauce on which these petals fell - with saffron, lemon, fennel and pickled mustard seeds - added bite to the dish without chomping down on it."
,"By slow-roasting halibut and basting it with brown butter, the kitchen teased out all the richness and moistness halibut can muster."
,"It produced boneless rack of veal as tender as could be and underscored its luxuriousness with morels braised in a sherry-like savagnin from the Jura and sauced with veal jus and a whisper of whipped cream. Thin slices of raw asparagus gave the dish some crunch and an even firmer tether to the season."
,"Almost everything I had in my recent visits was exquisitely cooked. I say almost because the lobster in a salad with pickled ginger and pistachio vinaigrette was a stringy disappointment. The smoking of lobster in an entree with a celery root pur\u00E9e only obscured its sweetness."
,"Maybe the kitchen should just stick with crab, whose sweetness came through clearly in the best appetizer, an \"open ravioli.\" House-made pasta cradled and defined strands of snow crab while a profusion of herbs, including parsley and dill, contributed color and nuance. Pale orange mussels, removed from their shells, were arrayed like a corona around everything else."
,"Mr. Anthony\u2019s menus for both the modestly elegant dining rooms and the more casual tables around the bar are new and different, but they respect the longstanding Gramercy spirit. They champion the \"new American\" style of cobbled-together influences in the service of relatively straightforward dishes. And they seem designed to appeal to a broad base, balancing a smoked trout appetizer with a tuna and beet tartare, tempering venison in two enormously appealing guises (loin and sausage) with pork two excellent ways (roasted rack and braised belly)."
,"They steer clear of anything too challenging, and if tameness is a consequence, so be it. Gramercy has never been a destination for the most adventurous or jaded gourmands."
,"Its current roster of desserts, now under the stewardship of the pastry chef Nancy Olson, may not be its strongest ever, but there are fine choices. Chief among them is a warm chocolate bread pudding that stands in, blessedly, for the molten chocolate cake on too many other menus and does that stalwart\u2019s gooey business more arrestingly."
,"Ms. Olson deftly tweaks the familiar, producing a quark cheesecake with fruity sidekicks - candied kumquat, a blood orange sorbet - more exotic than the usual suspects."
,"The thoughtfully assembled wine list spans many styles and budgets. The service is back on track, with its trademark blend of coddling and unpretentiousness, a mix that Gramercy nailed well before other restaurants and that explains a lot about diners\u2019 loyalty to the restaurant. They find comfort in rooms with well-spaced tables and one rustic touch for every two elegant flourishes. Gramercy Tavern is a homey retort to the slickness of some fine-dining peers, and minor changes to lighting and art have made it look fresher, less where your grandmother goes after needlepoint class and more where your aunt goes after Italian for the Umbria-bound."
,"It doesn\u2019t scale peaks as high as those at Eleven Madison Park, currently the most exciting restaurant in Mr. Meyer\u2019s collection. But like a solid marriage rather than a heady love affair, it has stood the test of time, righting itself when it starts to go wrong, knowing that what\u2019s at stake are a great many warm memories, some yet to be made."

"ALMOST dusk in Flushing, Queens, the crowds thick on the sidewalk in front of Imperial Palace, people already waiting for tables to clear. Multigenerational Chinese predominate, the elderly leaning on parked cars while children run or pout and moms and dads work mobile devices against the delay. Past the scrum at the door is a room familiar to anyone who\u2019s done time in Chinatown banquet halls: long and crowded, with big round tables that run all the way through to the back, and a small wall of aquariums halfway down, by the kitchen. Fat grouper are in there, black bass, eel, crab, crab and crab stacked tight."
,"It is crab most everyone awaits - Dungeness, cooked over sticky rice and river leaves in a bamboo steamer, dotted with scallion. Cut through into pieces, the hard shells cracked, their essence exudes over time into the rice, bounces slowly off the vegetal bass note of the leaves and rides into the soft bite of the scallion, making the whole dish combine into flavors that are rich and complicated and delicious beyond compare."
,"Crab is the restaurant\u2019s calling card. But a series of meals taken there over the last few months say more: The Palace is riding high, at the zenith of Cantonese cooking in New York City."
,"Time was in New York City that eating Chinese food meant eating Cantonese food, however bastardized: light stir-fries, lots of ginger and scallion, black-bean sauce, crisp chicken, steamed fish. This was true all over the United States. After all, China\u2019s first immigrants to America were from Canton - Guangzhou these days - and on their backs were Chinatowns built. These men - and they were men at first, almost entirely - cooked what they remembered from home. They cooked as best they could without wives and sisters and mothers, and then they adapted the result to the tastes of those who suddenly wanted not just to taste what they smelled cooking in their work camps and crowded urban neighborhoods, but to buy it and often."
,"Thus were Chinese restaurants in America born. That sweet and sour pork you ordered in a mall in Scranton came out of Canton in some way; so too the chow mein you ate in a school cafeteria, the dim sum you had one hung-over morning in a city not your own."
,"Lately, of course, patterns of immigration have changed. Since the 1990s, at least, the bulk of Chinese immigrants to the United States have been from elsewhere in China, especially from Fujian province, and they have brought their own cooking with them. Among the food-obsessed in New York, interest in Cantonese food has faded as it has risen in the spicy (and tasty!) flavors of China\u2019s interior."
,"Imperial Palace does something to reverse the trend. Entirely on the fly, it is possible to eat brilliantly there, in the manner of an improvised Cantonese banquet. It is not a formal restaurant nor in any way a perfect one; service can be slapdash, particularly if you speak no Chinese. But the cooking is extremely sophisticated. Those who miss the quiet, deep flavors of the cooking at Eileen Leong\u2019s late, lamented Canton on Division Street would do well to book passage to Queens."
,"Start with clams cooked in black-bean sauce. The sweet brininess of the shellfish is a nice foil to the briny sweetness of the fermented beans, with the lightest beat of fire behind them. (Advanced students may prefer the Palace\u2019s periwinkle version of the dish instead, each shell drilled out at the end for easy sucking and devouring of the snails within.)"
,"Smart joes will try an order of salt-baked duck tongues, the tongues crunchy and sweet and firm around their cartilage centers, and a plate of cold jellyfish salad bright with the flavors of soy and black vinegar, sparkling with pepper. There are giant, three-slurp steamed Pacific oysters, too, dressed in spicy, salty, XO sauce - a taste of Hong Kong."
,"Soup is a must, either before one really starts to eat or after: a silky corn chowder with minced white chicken, for instance, or verdant, porky mustard greens and white pillows of tofu in a glistening broth. Dried scallops and ham? This is a salty perfection in stock that tastes of both, what Calvin Trillin would call a double-trayf special. Once at lunch a waiter suggested a clam casserole served in what the menu calls the Vietnamese style: beautiful little scrubbed clams in a fiery chicken stock built strong with chilies and onion. Strewn with coriander stems, with a few lemon slices and cut red onion, it was a palate scrubber, exactly the sort of taste shocker that gets a person ready to feast."
,"If you\u2019re eating with more than three or four people, the restaurant\u2019s deep-fried chicken with minced shrimp makes an excellent mid-meal snack. A perfect brown sheet of fried chicken skin, cut into a rectangle, appears on a plate, blanketing a thin futon of minced shrimp that is cased on its bottom with fried panko. The dish is crisp and soft at once, a marvel of technical cooking. It is astonishingly rich and flavorful besides. Meanwhile, an order of that Chinatown standby of deep-fried chicken reveals a bird that is no slouch in the flavor department itself: lacquered and sweet and moist, served with a small bowl of fermented red bean sauce through which to drag the meat. (The Peking duck here is credible, but you wouldn\u2019t take the 7 train to the end of the line to eat it.)"
,"Then sable served sizzling over more black bean sauce, like a special at Nobu or a gift from a friend. And a wok-fried gray sole (the restaurant calls it flounder) to giggle over: smooth chunks of thick, perfect, curving boneless meat served above snow peas, celery and the fish\u2019s deep-fried and half-edible skeleton, crunch to counter the velvet flesh."
,"Pork chops in the Peking style arrive in a tangle: deep-fried and dressed in a sweet and sour sauce that makes a mockery of the neon gloop you find in strip-mall versions of the dish. More fried meat: sweet lamb chops with Chinese celery, crispy garlic and red onion, chewy, rich and satisfying. Snow pea leaves with egg sauce? Yes, that would be nice."
,"Is an order of lobster over sticky rice better than the Dungeness crab over same? It would be a fun argument to have over big steamers of each, to be sure, picking at shells, eating rice gone pungent and rich with broth, slightly musky from the leaves that line the bamboo steamer."
,"Either way, though, it\u2019s the dish to end your meal: a sticky, garlicky, sweet adventure, one of the city\u2019s great meals. Then eat your canned pineapple and beat it. Someone wants your table."

"UP and down Japan, Ippudo ramen shops are renowned for their tonkotsu broth, the richest style of this noodle soup. What French fonds de veau is to veal, tonkotsu is to pork."
,"The purest expression of tonkotsuism can now be found at the company\u2019s first extranational outpost, Ippudo NY on Fourth Avenue in the East Village, in a bowl of its flagship soup, shiomaru NY ramen ($13)."
,"The broth is the color of bones, with a meaty, smoky, even nutty flavor. It\u2019s sparingly garnished with a little fatty pork, some sliced scallions and a few cabbage leaves: a pleasingly austere accent for such an unctuous, rich broth."
,"The akamaru modern ramen ($13) builds on the shiomaru template to make a bowl of noodle soup about as good as any in the city. There are the same noodles, same broth, but with more going on in the bowl. A dash of garlickly oil, a soyish splash, a few more veggies set off an umami bomb in a bowl."
,"Ippudo also offers miso ramen ($12) that delivers plenty of nutty, sweet miso flavor, and shoyu (soy sauce) ramen ($12) that are a tad one-note. Shoyu is like that: it will take over if you let it."
,"But both soups are tasty alternatives to sample on a third or fourth trip to Ippudo, after you\u2019ve spent some quality time with the shiomaru and akamaru ramen soups."
,"As for the ramen itself, every noodle in every bowl of soup I slurped - particularly the spaghettini-size strands in the shiomaru and akamaru - was cooked perfectly al dente. (And in a move that would make Mister Rogers proud, the machine that makes those noodles has been put on display in the basement, through a window slashed into a wall of the downstairs kitchen.)"
,"A good number of dishes are on the menu in addition to the ramen, some of which flop, like the almost completely flavorless take on caprese salad, while others soar, like a bubbling hot pot of tofu and pork in a dark, complex, lightly spicy sauce."
,"As a rule, the more traditional-style dishes - like a peculiarly appealing sweet rendition of dashimaki tamago, a rolled omelet flavored with dashi and mirin - bested the nouveau dishes (though a special of fried shrimp with a Caesar-like mayonnaise-based dressing did impress)."
,"Unlike most ramen shops around town, Ippudo\u2019s a looker, with a design scheme that feels like a stage set, maybe for a samurai battle in an evil shogun\u2019s futuristic fun house."
,"Mirrors are deployed to good and sometimes disorienting effect throughout. Oversize murals - one huge one of Japanese calligraphy, another of Japanese warriors - abound."
,"The restaurant is shaped like a horseshoe. You enter through the bar area at the top left of the U (where you cool your heels for a while waiting for a table unless you go on a weekday for lunch). Then you walk through a hallway into the main dining room, where shouting cooks work in an open kitchen, adding to the visual chaos and to the cacophony of the nu-metal music blaring through a tinny sound system. Round the corner is a narrow hallwaylike space with some extra tables: ramenya Siberia."
,"Siberia or not, loathsome music or (preferably) not, the soup is always on point: the noodles are always cooked right, and the tonkotsu broth is unwaveringly flavor-packed."

"THERE'S a secret to the surprising mellowness of the \"legendary mutton chop\" at Keens Steakhouse, a restaurant long synonymous with that gargantuan slab of meat. (The menu announces it with a verbal trumpet blast.)"
,"There's a simple reason it has none of the gaminess that diners expect of mutton, which is sheep, and instead reminds them of lamb, the younger version they know and trust."
,"Nix the trumpet and commence a drum roll: it is lamb. The mutton lore is a mutton lie. For at least two decades and perhaps many more, the legendary mutton chop has indeed been a matter of legend. The following sentence is inevitable, as is the one on its tail. Diners have had the wool pulled over their eyes."
,"But they haven't been fleeced. The mutton chop at Keens, a 26-ounce saddle of lamb, skirted with fat and nearly two inches tall, can wear whatever label it pleases, because it provides about as much pleasure as a carnivore could want."
,"So, for that matter, does Keens, a meaty Mecca since 1885, artery-clogging proof that not all good things must come to pass, though they may indeed have to adapt to new times by toying with certain traditions."
,"In the case of Keens, those traditions include true-blue mutton chops, which it once served. It kept the name even after it lost the sheep. It's nostalgic like that."
,"No restaurant in New York City pays the kind of lavish, often kooky, sometimes even touching tribute to the past that Keens does."
,"Look to the ceilings of various dining rooms, which are spread over two floors of three connected townhouses, and behold row upon row of clay pipes. There are more than 50,000 of them, the property of Keens customers who, in tobacco-friendlier times, stowed and used them in the restaurant."
,"Keens had what it called a pipe club, with members including Babe Ruth and Theodore Roosevelt. Even after smoking in restaurants went the way of absinthe, Keens inducted honorary members into the club, famous customers as diverse as Dr. Ruth Westheimer and Dr. Renee Richards, Liza Minnelli and Stephen King. There are pipes bearing their signatures in a glass case beside the main entrance."
,"Keens is a trove not only of protein but also of memorabilia. Its dark-paneled walls display vintage photographs, vintage political cartoons and vintage playbills."
,"On a poignant note, in a room often used for private dining, Keen has what it identifies as the theatrical program that Abraham Lincoln was holding when he was shot."
,"On a humorous note, in the main vestibule, it has what it identifies as \"dinosaur sirloin,\" supposedly a fossil from the Red Rocks area of Utah. It looks like reddish-brown marble, and a sign with it says that in the opinion of Keens, it has not yet been aged long enough to be cooked."
,"Keens expertly dry-ages its beef, which it serves in an array of cuts, all of them memorable and almost all of them mammoth: sirloin, filet mignon, prime rib, porterhouse for two, porterhouse for three."
,"On my visits the restaurant put a nice char on any and every cut that was supposed to have it, and it cooked everything to its requested temperature. It proved itself to be not only one of the city's most charming and diverting theaters for testosterone cuisine but also one of its most reliable."
,"And it presented a few surprisingly effective cameos, most notably a fried chicken salad available only at lunch. Morsels of tender breast kept company with hunks of Stilton cheese, several kinds of lettuces and a sparingly applied vinaigrette."
,"Keens doesn't consign a diner to iceberg with blue cheese, though that's a very happy fate. It also serves a salad of arugula, bibb lettuce, basil and watercress, and both times I had it, the greens and herbs were springy and fresh."
,"Other digressions from the beefy, lamby norm proved perilous. A half chicken had been left on the rotisserie at least 10 minutes too long. A gigantic wedge of salmon had an impressively silken texture but a muffled flavor. (Was it really wild, as the menu claimed?) Fried calamari were a rubbery wreck."
,"It could be argued that a person who orders these dishes in a steakhouse gets what he or she deserves. But a steakhouse should come through with a stronger lineup of desserts than Keens did. Most of the ones I tried were instantly forgettable."
,"The service was usually a graceful departure from the studied gruffness of some other traditional steakhouses. Keens paid attention to details."
,"A glass of iced tea arrived with a fresh mint leaf floating on its surface. A refill wasn't a refill: it was a new glass with a new leaf. Water was poured from a pewter pitcher. In deference to the holiday season, a big stuffed moose head wore a little red Santa cap."
,"Keens is mischievous like that. Cue the mutton."
,"Because Keens changed ownership in the late 1970's, a definitive, comprehensive mutton history seems to be out of reach. But the restaurant's current manager, Bonnie Jenkins, investigated the matter at my request."
,"Keens began with real mutton, which is often defined in this country as sheep of about a year or more in age. In 1935, the restaurant reached and publicly celebrated a milestone: one million mutton chops served. Apparently, Keens was an early, upscale McDonald's of mutton."
,"World War II came. Deprived Americans ate more mutton than they wanted, and as it later fell farther and farther out of fashion, getting fresh mutton of reliable quality became iffy. At some point Keens had to turn to lamb, choosing a cut with a winged shape that mimicked the mutton chop of yore."
,"Keens was using lamb in place of mutton when its current owner reopened it in 1981 following several years of extensive renovations. It was using lamb when subsequent newspaper and magazine articles about Keens appeared under headlines like \"Mutton Place\" and \"Of Mutton and Men.\""
,"And it is using lamb now, although it tries to get lamb around 10 months in age, which is older than most of the lamb we eat, including the thick-cut rack at Keens."
,"That doesn't make it mutton, but it does seem to give it a more robust taste, like lamb with an exponent, lamb on steroids. Call it near-mutton. Call it extreme lamb. Go ahead and call it legendary. In more ways than one, it warrants that tag."

"THE black soup arrives at the table already staining the sides of its wide white bowl, an inelegant-looking thing, lampblack-hued, shimmery with oil, menacing, its velvet surface rippled by off-white tangles of squid, by dull green spears of long bean. Stab a spoon into it to discover coins of flesh that lie in its depths, squid rings stuffed with brisket. The smell of sesame drifts upward on threads of steam."
,"The flavors are intense and specific - squid ink and the sesame oil, long bean and soft brisket, the squid itself and a chili fire. They combine beautifully. And consumed on a winter\u2019s evening as snow flurries whip the streets outside, they serve as a marvelous introduction to Kin Shop, a new restaurant on Avenue of the Americas in Greenwich Village."
,"Kin Shop is notionally a Thai restaurant. (Kin means \"to eat\" in Thai.) But it isn\u2019t a Thai restaurant, really, even if there\u2019s a magical food stand somewhere in Phuket serving squid-ink and hot sesame-oil soup featuring brisket-stuffed squid rings. Kin Shop is instead an American restaurant that serves food prepared using Thai flavors, a restaurant that nods at Thailand respectfully and uses its cuisine to fine effect."
,"It does so in an atmosphere that is at once cool and neighborly, downtown in a box. There is something of that small-town-in-the-big-city feel."
,"The food is served family style, as it comes from the kitchen. Service is of the nice-people variety, professional without being snide, competent without being overeager."
,"Piles of sweet Massaman curry with braised goat sit on some tables, alongside wide stir-fried rice noodles with chicken sausage, broccoli rabe and slick oyster sauce. Here is happiness in a piece of sweet Montauk fluke marinated in kaffir lime, with pomelo, radish and a sauce made of galangal and turmeric: Southeast Asian Suffolk County food, as fresh as morning. There is a bowl of egg noodles swimming in a broth of maitake mushrooms, with a poached duck egg, some tiny leeks, some flags of spinach: umami-rich, coating mouths in silk."
,"The chef and an owner of Kin Shop is Harold Dieterle, who some years ago was the winner in the first season of the televised cooking competition \"Top Chef.\" With Alicia Nosenzo, his business partner and floor general (a veteran of the similarly smart-casual restaurants the Red Cat, the Harrison and the Mermaid Inn), he also has the more subtly Asian restaurant Perilla on Jones Street, a few blocks south."
,"Mr. Dieterle is as Thai as John Boehner. But he cooks from the Thai larder as if he had stepped out of a novel by John Burdett, a farang who can see ghosts, who knows that the mind is Buddha\u2019s seat, who bleeds fish sauce."
,"His red curry, which he serves as a dipping sauce for ruby-red roasted duck breast, comes with the crisp, thick roti common to southern Thailand, with green mango, cilantro and basil. Place a meaty slice of duck on a piece of the thick, slightly greasy bread, cover it with fruit and herbs, then add a drizzle of sauce. The intensely concentrated red-curry flavor is a beautiful match for the rare duck meat, and cloaks it as cheese does a transcendent hamburger, elevating the protein by its presence."
,"Mr. Dieterle does well by duck in general, though a terrific early salad of boned duck tongues has sadly disappeared from view. (They might have become the General Tso\u2019s chicken of Thai-inspired restaurant cooking.) But his duck laab is excellent - a salad of minced duck meat with toasted rice and ground chilies that he serves with hearts of romaine. The dish carries a fish-sauce tang along with red-alert heat, and is recommended to all who will otherwise complain that the restaurant isn\u2019t authentically Thai enough for their liking."
,"He serves a honking good salad of fried pork and crisp oysters in which both the mollusks and the pig parts are significantly larger than you might expect, and enhanced by a vinaigrette of mint, chili and lime, with celery and peanuts for contrast."
,"A tangle of stir-fried \"aquatic vegetables\" (water spinach and watercress, with water chestnuts), meanwhile, offers a welcome purity of flavor, while a collection of grilled eggplant varieties dances under a dressing redolent of fish sauce and mint, studded with pearls of toasted rice cereal. It makes for good eating."
,"That is not to say Mr. Dieterle never stumbles. Desserts are lame: a steamed passion-fruit pudding with chemical-flavored buttermilk ice cream; muddy Thai iced-tea ice cream; a sickly sweet pineapple-tamarind sorbet."
,"And some of the savory dishes clank as well. Pan-fried crab noodles with yellow chives and tatsoi is fiery and bland at once. Grilled river prawns with fresh lime and a Phuket-style black pepper sauce lacks pow: it tastes of hotel cooking and evokes mild depression."
,"Better to order fiery Thai sausages with a steamed duck egg in a red-onion congee, with razor clams and a sauce made of garlic and fried Thai basil: a winter\u2019s stew from a land that knows no winter. That and some roasted bones, their marrow glistening alongside taro root, radish greens, a yellow bean sauce and a pile of roti. It can keep a table occupied for some time."
,"The restaurant has a smart and modest wine list, one that leans heavily on bright whites and sparklers that can hold up to Mr. Dieterle\u2019s food. (Cocktails include a wonderful martini named for Ms. Nosenzo, made with Farmer\u2019s gin and spicy pickle juice.)"
,"But beer may make more sense, with selections that include the requisite Singha lager and an excellent India pale ale from Nectar, as well as a fascinating dark lager from Laos that pairs nicely with that squid-ink soup."
,"Kin Shop is not a fancy restaurant. Nor is it precisely an ambitious one. It is, simply, a neighborhood gem, serving heat and comfort alike, to great effect. Locals crowd the bar, drink beer, devour their goat and can count themselves lucky."

"LA GRENOUILLE turned 47 on Saturday, the last great French restaurant in New York. As on its birth night, there was snow outside the old stable at 3 East 52nd Street, and this made the soft, glittering light of the brocaded interior seem all the more inviting, the flowers towering out of the corners all the more welcoming, the sheer elegance of the place all the more arresting, important, rare."
,"The decline of great French cooking in New York has been a subject of discussion among the food-obsessed for decades, since at least the closing of Le Pavillon in 1971. In the last decade the talk has turned funereal, with the demise of Lut\u00E8ce, La Caravelle, La C\u00F4te Basque, Lespinasse."
,"Brasserie cooking survives in New York, even flourishes under old mirrors and subway tile. We will always have steak frites."
,"But the quiet opulence of the traditional haute cuisine that was first brought to New York by Henri Soul\u00E9 for the World\u2019s Fair in 1939 and which flourished at his Pavillon and other restaurants in the years that followed? The whole marvelous Tom Wolfe scene of it: blanquette de veau and Beaumes-de-Venise, and ladies in finery beside gentlemen in soft cashmere jackets and rolled silk ties? C\u2019est fini!"
,"A series of recent meals at La Grenouille suggests that isn\u2019t so. Not so long as Charles Masson, who has run it since 1975, greets his customers at the door, quiet and French and welcoming. Not so long as people can take a seat on a scarlet banquette at his restaurant, sit beneath a spray of flowers and eat sumptuous food out of Escoffier. It has been this way since his father, also named Charles, opened the restaurant in 1962 with his wife, Gis\u00E8le."
,"The crowd is amazing. There are city patricians, upscale travelers, romantics celebrating anniversaries, cads with escort-service friends, priests drinking Burgundy and spooning soup past their dog collars. There is jewelry everywhere, evidence of plastic surgery."
,"There are Thackeray characters come to life in a modern age. Some have spent too much time in the sun, doing nothing much more than turning the pages of a book. Others, eyes darting back and forth, examine the restaurant and chart customers as handicappers do horses at Belmont: Are the flowers less resplendent than in years past? Perhaps, ever so slightly, yes. Is the carpet threadbare? Not in the least, though those waiters may qualify! Is that a daughter or lover in the corner with that old lion? Oh, please. Have the Montrachet to start?"
,"Back in the kitchen, the executive chef, Matthew Tropeano, spoons forcemeat pike into simmering broth. He naps the result with sauce and gives the plates to waiters who have known no other service. They present their customers a paragon of quenelles de brochet in the Lyonnaise style, a textbook example of classic French cuisine."
,"The dish is executed perfectly, a kind of beige-on-beige masterpiece devoid of irony or deconstructionist camp. (Only those without heart would call it gefilte fish.) It is delicious without being overwhelming, without being much more than ethereal pike, light as mist, buttery rice, a shellfish cream sauce with just a hint of nutmeg, a dab of American caviar. It is wonderful to eat at La Grenouille."
,"The revelations start early. A waiter brings an amuse-bouche, perhaps more perfunctorily than is currently normal in most New York restaurants. He neither issues a greeting nor attempts to make the action dramatic."
,"\"This is a split pea soup,\" he says. The offering is roughly four spoonfuls\u2019 worth. Each is a cloud of magnificent flavor - salt that raises the vegetal from its depths, cream that makes it buoyant. It lingers on the tongue. The tiny dish expands the mind."
,"It also concentrates its focus. For there will be no lemon grass foam to confuse matters on the menu of La Grenouille this evening, no huckleberry confit or magret sliders."
,"This is a classic French restaurant (with classically high prices; a three-course prix fixe dinner starts at $95). Its strength is still, as Bryan Miller wrote in The New York Times almost 20 years ago, the excellence of its stocks, the basis of its magnificent sauces."
,"Begin your meal with sweetbreads, then. They are the thymus gland of a calf, two lobes separated by a soft tube of flesh. (Someone always asks!) Here they are trimmed in the manner of miniature chicken breasts, then saut\u00E9ed until crisp, leaving a creamy interior."
,"Accompanied by a small bit of demi-glace made piney with rosemary, they provide an instant view of a world in which plenty is not nearly so important as quality - a world in which the point is to experience small, rich pleasures, one by one by one."
,"In that line, there is also foie gras, of course, fattened duck liver seared beautifully and served with port, melting velvet in the mouth. There is a magnificent country terrine, studded with pistachios and served blessedly at the temperature of the room, so that it spreads easily and caresses the tongue."
,"On a brisk winter evening, you might begin with risotto, now served with buttery wild mushrooms, each grain separate and pliant and rich."
,"A slightly rakish salmon tartare arrives piled on a large and perfect blini with more of that American caviar on top to heighten the experience. (Ravioli with lobster and tarragon achieves a similar effect, plus cream.)"
,"And a simple endive salad highlights the bitter sweetness of the green, then sweetens it with slick pear, chalky walnut, the rough, salty excellence of Roquefort cheese."
,"For main dishes, there are those quenelles. Also frogs\u2019 legs saut\u00E9ed in butter with parsley and garlic, a nod to the restaurant\u2019s name (in France, une grenouille is a frog). The legs are delicate, flavorful, addictive and impossible even in this luxe setting to finish with knife and fork. (The waiter will bring you a finger bowl when you are done.) There is an excellent plate of veal kidneys, saut\u00E9ed in a flash of Cognac until just browned around the exterior, served with a thick, piquant mustard sauce. There is another of sirloin, crimson beef dominoes on a plate, with creamy pommes boulang\u00E8re."
,"There are beef oxtails of uncommon excellence, braised until sticky in red wine, a dish the late Pat Buckley once said she would choose as her last on Earth."
,"And for those experiencing the restaurant for the first time, or returning to it for the first time in ages, there is Dover sole. Named for the English port in which it was first popularized, Dover sole is slightly less bathmat-shaped than its relative the flounder. It is prized by diners for close-grained sweet flavor, and by restaurants for ease of filleting, which is why it\u2019s so often done tableside."
,"Here, grilled and then sauced with butter, and served with soft, golden mustard sauce, it achieves a kind of transfiguration: France brought to Midtown, a vacation in a bite. It\u2019ll change the color of your mood ring."
,"Let us stay happy through the end of this meal. Wise diners will, as they order the sole, also ask for the preparation of a souffl\u00E9 for dessert, perhaps the one scented with Grand Marnier. (The unwise will ask for tarte Tatin and receive a wan example in return.)"
,"During the winter of 1997, when La Grenouille was just 35, Ruth Reichl wrote in the restaurant\u2019s most recent review in these pages that it was not for nothing that a parade of souffl\u00E9s crosses the dining room each evening. \"I don\u2019t think there is a better souffl\u00E9 in New York,\" she wrote, and awarded three stars."
,"That is still the case. It is a magic-trick dessert, a dreamlike concoction from the night kitchen: perfection unsullied. And it stands, in its way, for the importance of La Grenouille. This is the bastion now. It is worth the expense to put on your best and experience it. It is part of why you are here."

"THERE is reason to pity the nearly perfect. They have so many ways to falter. In thrall to their own legend, they might well overreach, trading glory for folly, or they might simply coast, converting acclaim into idle narcissism. They might allow self-assurance to bleed into arrogance and let down their guard against error."
,"These are a few of the traps that Le Bernardin has faced - and avoided - for nearly two decades. It grabbed hold of four stars from Bryan Miller in The New York Times less than three months after it opened in early 1986 and has never let them slip from its grasp, maintaining its superior rating more than twice as long as any of the other New York restaurants in its elite company. (The runner-up, Jean Georges, earned four stars in mid-1997.) None of its peers have built legends so large and sturdy."
,"All of its peers can learn from its example. Le Bernardin has aged with astonishing grace, more Deneuve than Dunaway, doing what it must to remain youthful without ever making an elastic fool of itself, staying true to its identity while adapting to changing times. Now as before, it is a high church of reverently prepared fish. But more than ever global currents inform and influence what emerges from a kitchen that can no longer be succinctly described as French."
,"Consider one of the best appetizers, a \"progressive tasting\" of four fluke ceviches that turns into a world tour. Reading the plates from left to right, first up is fish that has been marinated in lime, cilantro and onion: Peru. Next, olive oil, tomato and basil are thrown into the mix: the Mediterranean. After that comes the addition of ponzu: Japan. And then the fish is finished with a splash of coconut milk: Thailand."
,"The flavors of Asia have beguiled Eric Ripert, who has been the chef at Le Bernardin for more than a decade and at first worked alongside Gilbert Le Coze. (Mr. Le Coze died in 1994; his sister, Maguy, still helms the ship.) Asian accents are scattered throughout a menu that bears scant resemblance to the one in 1995, when Le Bernardin was last reviewed in The Times and received a fresh four stars from Ruth Reichl. Mr. Ripert enlivens a fantastic hamachi tartare with a ginger-coriander emulsion and wasabi-infused tobiko. Cardamom and yuzu make appearances in other dishes, joining a distinctly international cast."
,"\"For a while our mantra at Le Bernardin was that the fish is the star,\" Mr. Ripert said in a telephone conversation after my visits to the restaurant, where he repeatedly recognized me. \"Today we are a little less fanatic about that.\" A little but not a lot, and therein lies both the secret to Le Bernardin's continued success and the reason I regularly field complaints from friends who found their experiences there disappointing."
,"Because of the restaurant's legend they expect a riot of flourishes, an explosion of fireworks. Nothing less than being made to levitate above the table will do. Le Bernardin does not work that way. Sure, it musters bits of incidental theater: in keeping with its French background it serves many appetizers and entrees with a final, fancy application of broth or sauce at the table."
,"But it eschews high drama, both in the dining room, which has all the sex appeal of a first-class airport lounge, and in the dishes, many of which are paradigms of subtlety. Only with careful attention do you register and revel in Le Bernardin's grace notes: a trio of tiny arugula leaves, all precisely the same size and each perfectly equidistant from the others, which surround codfish, providing vaguely bitter, peppery, mintlike hints."
,"You can absent-mindedly polish off an appetizer of barely poached lobster in a broth of butter, Champagne and chives and know that you are eating something good. Or you can pause, ponder and realize that you are eating something with an exquisite balance of colors, shapes and flavors. The amorphous clumps of sweet white lobster meat sit atop coin-shape bits of mango, which are orange and slightly acidic, and below rectangles of avocado, which are green and vaguely unctuous. The full Epicurean appeal of the dish reveals itself only upon close scrutiny. Le Bernardin is a restaurant for people who really focus on the food."
,"It has made modern adjustments in addition to its journey into a wider world of flavors. A few years ago it changed its prix fixe dinner from three courses (appetizer, entree, dessert) to four smaller ones (two appetizers, entree, dessert), which better accommodate today's adventurous grazers. The savory courses are divided into three categories - almost raw, barely touched and lightly cooked - which underscore Le Bernardin's sustained belief in the sacredness of piscine flesh."
,"The pastry chef, Michael Laiskonis, came aboard less than a year ago, and his exemplary desserts - including crispy wafers layered with hazelnut and caramel and a dark chocolate, cashew and caramel tart - stay true to the rest of the meal. They are sophisticated without being pretentious, multifaceted but not unduly fanciful."
,"Mr. Ripert just turned 40 and has not lost any of his passion. Except for occasional appearances on the \"Late Show With David Letterman\" and his participation six years ago in an advertising campaign that featured chefs in the buff, he has sidestepped the more flamboyant manifestations of celebrity chefdom. He has resisted imperial impulses, confining most of his work outside Le Bernardin to consulting. His dedication shows."
,"\"This is what sushi only wishes it could be,\" one dinner companion said as his fork all but sank of its own weight into an entree of wild salmon with an arrestingly vivid hue and taste. The fish inhabited a limbo between raw and rare, which was just where it belonged. You may encounter preparations at Le Bernardin with less ostentatious complexity than you expect, but you will never doubt that the fish is of the highest quality and has received the utmost care."
,"Some dishes soar on the luxuriousness of their ingredients. \"This is a love affair,\" another dinner companion sighed as she savored a criminally opulent ragout of scallop, langoustine, clam, sea urchin and caviar, an appetizer that entails a $60 supplement to the $92 prix fixe."
,"Other dishes excel because Mr. Ripert knows what makes a good match, knows monkfish is meaty enough to be married to a hearty paprika sauce but halibut needs something less forceful. He weds it to a lemon grass and coconut sauce, Asia entering the picture yet again."
,"Le Bernardin may be the most confident restaurant in the city. Consider another of its best appetizers: thin layers of yellowfin tuna, foie gras and toasted baguette, which compose a symphony of crunch and ooze, hard and soft. Another restaurant would be tempted to go heavier on the foie gras, to go for broke. But Le Bernardin holds the ingredient and the effect in check, doing justice to the adjective \"tantalizing.\""
,"This restaurant's confidence also comes through in its portions, which are judiciously restrained, and in its service, which is expert but unintrusive. Epitomizing a certain kind of class, Le Bernardin amounts to the restaurant equivalent of old money, so secure in its station that it need not strut, so practiced in its posture that it never slouches. And yet it somehow avoids stodginess and complacency, a minor miracle that, for us diners, is a major blessing."

"RENOWN in the restaurant world can dawn so suddenly and grow so quickly that many chefs get ahead of themselves, winding up a half-dozen paces beyond where they rightfully belong."
,"For Andrew Carmellini, the opposite has been true. Now 38, he has lagged behind, without billing as prominent or a showcase quite as flattering as he deserves."
,"Although insiders knew that he, as much as Daniel Boulud, deserved credit for the outstanding French fare at Caf\u00E9 Boulud during his years there, the restaurant\u2019s name told the world something different. And each superb dish he turned out burnished another man\u2019s crown."
,"When he left in 2005 to open A Voce, he got his own kitchen, where he did some of the city\u2019s best Italian cooking. But A Voce\u2019s coolly modern, oddly soulless cosmetics were more of a drag on his efforts than a complement to them."
,"And the atmosphere was tense - between him and his partners, that is. After just two and a half years they broke up, and he went from having a restaurant that didn\u2019t do him full justice to having no restaurant at all. So he began to make plans for a little East Village pasta joint. I\u2019m sure it would have been terrific. It also would have been a crime."
,"Mr. Carmellini\u2019s talent demands a bigger stage, and luckily for both him and us, Locanda Verde came along in the nick of time to give him that."
,"It opened two months ago in the TriBeCa space inhabited briefly - and disastrously - by Ago, may it rest in peace. It has more than 100 seats and a crack team of partners including Ken Friedman, of the Spotted Pig, and Josh Pickard, of Lever House. And it has a kitchen and a staff large enough to execute a menu with about 35 dishes, not counting desserts, on a given night."
,"But in keeping with the Carmellini story, Locanda Verde doesn\u2019t amount to the exactly right situation or perfect fit for him. It\u2019s not the Carmellini restaurant that many of us have been waiting and hoping for, though it has plenty to recommend it. Hit the menu\u2019s strong spots and you\u2019ll have a terrific meal at a reasonable price."
,"Like the menu at A Voce, the one here is emphatically market-driven, as the restaurant\u2019s name (which means \"green inn\") telegraphs. But the dishes in aggregate tend to be more rustic and less elegant, perhaps a reflection of Mr. Carmellini\u2019s mood, certainly a reflection of the moment."
,"By portioning and tagging roughly half of them as \"cicchetti\" (snacks) or antipasti, Locanda Verde sidesteps sticker shock; even the entrees tread cautiously, most $25 or less. And to go with the restrained prices there\u2019s a casual mood - too casual at times."
,"No matter how obviously I fumbled with a shoulder bag or clumsily shoved it under a chair, no one offered to check it. Has the restaurant taken a pass on that service? The prices aren\u2019t that gentle - and, for some diners, they won\u2019t make up for the frenzy and noise on a crowded night."
,"This is nonetheless a serious restaurant, so vastly superior to Ago that it\u2019s sacrilegious even to mention the two in the same sentence. Here\u2019s my groveling penance, a bent-knee litany of all that\u2019s improved:"
,"The wine list. Assembled by Josh Nadel, it engineers a wide-ranging, cost-conscious tour of Italy. The Barolo scrooges out there will wish for more big reds and a little more age, but focus instead on how many northern Italian wines are under $60 a bottle and on what a fine selection of whites - sylvaner, Soave, ribolla gialla, arneis - there is."
,"The d\u00E9cor. Mr. Friedman toned down the farmhouse and generic-trattoria elements and made everything look glossier and a bit more industrial. That suits and reflects the neighborhood, into which the restaurant merrily spills, thanks to the elimination of exterior walls in good weather."
,"The desserts. The Locanda team had the fantastically good sense to recruit Karen DeMasco, whose work at Craft established her as one of the city\u2019s leading pastry chefs. The many standout sweets here include a toasted almond semifreddo and a rice custard gelato, which tastes like rice pudding in a smoother, colder, more comely guise."
,"The rest of the food. There\u2019s hardly a false step among the cicchetti and antipasti, some not that ambitious but most immensely appealing. The sheep\u2019s milk ricotta that the restaurant imports from Sardinia is sublime, and so was the summer corn that joined mushrooms on top of crunchy bread."
,"Anything involving crunchy bread is worth ordering, including a crostino of blue crab and jalape\u00F1o that underscored Mr. Carmellini\u2019s willingness to stray beyond established Italian traditions. But don\u2019t load up on crostini at the expense of an appetizer of meaty, tender grilled octopus, served with an almond romesco, or of the juicy lamb meatball sliders, this restaurant\u2019s answer to A Voce\u2019s duck meatballs."
,"The pasta dishes and entrees weren\u2019t as uniformly successful. While the \"Sunday night rag\u00F9\" on top of big, floppy gigantoni was a porky dream and while a dish called \"my grandmother\u2019s ravioli\"- filled with short rib and pork and sauced with San Marzano tomatoes - made me want to swap ancestors with Mr. Carmellini, the crumbled mix of meats in a white Bolognese was a total washout, and the noodles in several dishes were slightly overcooked. Neither his grandmother nor mine would approve."
,"I found myself wishing for the opulence of some of his A Voce dishes, and got a hint of it in the charcoal-grilled squab, lavishly attired in pancetta, Swiss chard, fennel and black mission figs. In a humbler but equally impressive vein, he does a sectioned chicken for two, prepared in the wood-burning brick oven, that was spectacularly moist on visit after visit, though the rosemary and garlic sometimes got out of hand."
,"Maybe because the scene is more raucous, the ambience more casual and the emphasis on affordability more pronounced, Mr. Carmellini isn\u2019t bringing the same precision to dishes here that he did at A Voce. He isn\u2019t yet hitting his stride."
,"So be it. His amble beats the impatient sprints of some of the upstarts around town."

"THERE is a moment at the beginning of most meals at Madangsui, Manhattan\u2019s best Korean barbecue restaurant, when someone at the table begins to laugh."
,"A small army of workers has been filling the table with small plates of banchan, the side dishes central to Korean restaurant cuisine, for what appears to be a minute straight. They add to this bounty bubbling iron bowls of bean paste casserole and steamed eggs, and bring vast piles of bright green lettuce and slaw, small bowls of sesame oil and salt, soybean paste and the fiery hot sauce known as kochujang."
,"They offer savory oyster pancakes, kimchi pancakes, steaming piles of cellophane noodles, bottles of beer, glasses of tea and kettles of soju, a kind of low-alcohol Korean vodka. The table fills and fills and fills, and at a certain point it begins to be ridiculous - there\u2019s no visible table anymore! - and someone starts to giggle at the crazy excess, the sheer weight of the experience."
,"Korea was poor for much of the last century. It spent almost 40 years as a colony under the boot of Japan. It was physically divided in the aftermath of World War II and suffered mightily in the war that followed. None of this was much good for the feeding of its citizenry. It should be no surprise that when prosperity finally came to the peninsula in the 1970s (came to South Korea at least), so too came a groaning board. As Americans well know, nothing says economic security like the inevitability of leftovers."
,"Madangsui is not much to look at, really, just a long fluorescent-illuminated room with chocolate accents, almost barnlike, with exhaust hoods over the tables and a carpet down the center, leading to the tea station, the bathrooms and the kitchen. The clientele runs to groups of celebratory young Koreans texting as they eat, office parties and passers-by from local hotels; it is hardly a clear picture of fine dining in New York. But jiminy crickets, is the dining fine."
,"There is kimchi among the banchan, of course: Napa cabbage fermented with chili peppers and salt, Korea\u2019s national dish. There is also a zucchini version, a bok choy one, a wonderful bouquet of tiny pickled scallion shoots. There are cold boiled bean sprouts fragrant with sesame oil, and salty tangles of wakame dressed with sweet vinegar, soft on the tongue, a kiss in a rock club, right after the show. There is boiled eggplant; dried shredded squid fried with hot chili sauce; occasionally there is a strange cold cabbage dish with bits of hot dog in it, or a crab split in two. A fellow could pick at these with his chopsticks for an hour and be pleased with the time spent."
,"There is raw beef as well, in a dish called yook hwe, slightly frozen and run through a grinder, then seasoned with sesame oil and raw egg: it\u2019s a beef tartare, essentially, that literally melts in the mouth."
,"The real purpose of the restaurant, though, is barbecue, to grill your own food right there at the table, on the gas grill built into its center, still covered in banchan, not yet lighted. That is why you are here. And you will get to it in due course: to fiery marinated pork and sweet, tender beef wrapped in lettuce and eaten as candy or tacos."
,"But first, a warning: responsibility for the pace of a meal at Madangsui belongs to the diner alone. Service at the restaurant is brisk, almost brutally efficient."
,"Order some appetizers to be sure. There is a long list on the menu, including steamed edamame, fried tofu and the Korean dumplings known as mandoo. Ignore these. Ask instead for some of those pancakes and for the restaurant\u2019s silky, mushroom-studded jap chae, cellophane noodles stir-fried with soy sauce, vegetables and a few strips of beef. These, paired with that salty, voluptuous oyster pancake, are the correct introduction to the restaurant\u2019s big, addictive flavors; they help to align the brain."
,"Order, too, a bowl of kimchi soup, bubbling and restorative in its heat; alternatively, you might try the mool naeng myun, a pile of thin buckwheat noodles in an icy, bracing broth."
,"But make sure not to ask for your barbecue, not yet. Diners who order soups and appetizers at the same time as main dishes at Madangsui will receive, far more often than not, the main dishes in advance of the appetizers. This throws a wrench into the works. Be firm on this point and be happy. Praemonitus praemunitus is what they say in Latin class: forewarned is forearmed."
,"The barbecue is excellent: fresh, glistening butterflied short rib, thin-sliced ribeye, brisket, tongue. There is pork belly and there are giant mushrooms; there are jumbo shrimp. Some meats are served plain, for dressing afterward in a sheet of sesame oil run through with salt and pepper, with a dash of bean paste. Others are served in marinades, in either a soy-based, fruit-thickened number that is almost reminiscent of teriyaki or a garlicky take on kochujang that tingles in the mouth, leads to sweat and more laughter. It is particularly good on pork. Best, perhaps, is the plain butterflied short rib known as saeng galbi."
,"The waitress redistributes the wealth on the table in such a way as to clear the stainless steel top for the grill. A runner then removes the top, and lights the gas hob below. This service tic is left over from the days when the grills were most often powered by glowing charcoal, brought in buckets from the kitchen by men with thick leather gloves. (There are still Korean restaurants in Manhattan that use live fire, most notably Kom Tang Soot Bul on West 32nd Street, which is a fine place to eat but does not match Madangsui for quality.)"
,"The waitress then uses tongs to place the meat on the grill top - a kind of modified broiler pan - and leaves it to bubble and spit. She will soon return to cut it with sharp scissors, and to turn it just so. Traditionally, waiters are responsible for the grilling in Korean restaurants. At Madangsui this can mean an almost manic attention to the progress of each piece of protein, a lot of prodding with the tongs. If you like a little more char on that bulgogi of yours, announce that you\u2019ll cook it yourself. No eyebrow stays raised in the presence of grilling self-confidence."
,"Now use your chopsticks to drag a piece of cooked meat through the mixture of sesame oil, salt and pepper. Place it on a piece of fresh romaine cupped in your opposite hand in the manner of a tortilla. Add to this some banchan, some slaw, perhaps a dot or two of bean paste or kochujang. Wrap and eat: heaven in Midtown, with cold beer besides."
,"Dessert\u2019s an orange cut into eighths. It tastes of magic and happiness."

"MAIALINO is the restaurateur Danny Meyer\u2019s latest venture, a Roman-style trattoria at the Gramercy Park Hotel. It is warm and familiar, comfortable, a trattoria in an imaginary Rome where everyone comes from Missouri and wants you above all else to have a nice time."
,"And what\u2019s wrong with that? Maialino is a very good restaurant. The food is by Nick Anderer, who had been at Babbo and Mr. Meyer\u2019s Gramercy Tavern. Mr. Anderer is a New Yorker, born in Indiana. But his cooking is the genuine article."
,"You\u2019ll find praiseworthy bucatini all\u2019amatriciana on the menu, with a thick, spicy tomato sauce studded with guanciale, the excellent cured hog\u2019s jowl known among the food-enthralled as face bacon. You\u2019ll find rich spaghetti alla carbonara as well, with more of that guanciale, as well as eggs and black pepper. It\u2019s breakfast, lunch and dinner in a bowl. You\u2019ll find stracciatella, the Roman chicken soup with thick strands of egg, a cold remedy, a soul-warmer, a find. You\u2019ll see offal, artichokes, mint. And of course you\u2019ll find pork. Maialino, in English, means little pig."
,"We\u2019ll get to it soon enough: roasted, braised, fried. But first, a drink at the bar, which sits near the entrance. It is long, wide and walnut, maybe the most cordial surface that the designer, David Rockwell, has ever put into a restaurant."
,"Much of Maialino looks like a Pottery Barn. But the bar is custom work: elegant and spare. It\u2019s as pleasant a place for a breakfast coffee or lunch salad as for an evening glass of Frascati."
,"The combination is rare in a bar, especially for the Gramercy Park Hotel, where the breakfast special used to be vodka to cure the shakes. Once a high-bohemian enclave, the Gramercy had some tough dances in the 1990s. It almost disappeared before Ian Schrager bought the building in 2003, and enlisted Julian Schnabel to help design the interiors."
,"Food followed, and Manhattan diners behind it. This took some time. (For a while the space that Maialino occupies was Wakiya, an upscale Chinese restaurant.) The dining room now opens to the west of the bar, showing weathered wood floors and oak wainscoting, past stations for bread and dessert, salumi and cheese. Here studious young men and women bend to the task of assembling cold antipasti and hot espressos alike, dressed in long bistro aprons and beanies: gastro-nerds studying at the University of Meyer."
,"Graduates work as waiters beyond them; doctoral students as managers. The young professor Stephen Mancini, who was the sommelier at Mr. Meyer\u2019s Union Square Cafe, is Maialino\u2019s restless and enthusiastic wine director. He circulates among the well-spaced tables, with their white tablecloths placed over blue-checked ones, talking diners through an all-Italian list filled with crazy finds."
,"\"The way this guy releases vintages, it\u2019s like he\u2019s Neil Young releasing live recordings,\" he said of Giuseppe Quintarelli, while pouring that vintner\u2019s 1998 Ca\u2019 del Merlo Valpolicella. \"He only does it when he\u2019s ready. It\u2019s rare. It\u2019s beautiful.\" And, at $104, it was a rare splurge that turned out to be worth the coin on a stranger\u2019s say-so."
,"Start with salumi. Mortadella from Emilia-Romagna is particularly nice, nutty and rich, with Tuscan salami from Berkeley, Calif., as its foil. There is soppressata from Long Island City, Queens; speck from the Alto Adige; and prosciutto from San Daniele and Parma. There is also one from La Quercia in Norwalk, Iowa. It matches the Italians in every aspect and exceeds them for lightness of flavor."
,"Antipasti are also a strong suit: luscious quasi-Roman standbys bulked up to American standards. Fried artichokes with an anchovy-rich sauce make a fine introduction, and celery root with a soft-boiled egg and shaved mullet roe deepens the acquaintance. Mr. Anderer\u2019s tripe is served in a tomato sauce with pecorino and mint. It\u2019s light, delicate even, slightly sweet, with a backbeat. You can dance to it."
,"Entrees bring a moist and flavorful plate of swordfish with mushrooms and fennel fronds, and another of crisp deviled chicken with black pepper and pickled chilies. There\u2019s a fair dish of lamb chops with sunchokes and radicchio, a passable sea bass with mizuna salad. Side dishes range from bright, spicy Swiss chard to sour, amazing Treviso alla piastra, like turbocharged radicchio, pungent in the extreme."
,"But let\u2019s talk pig. It is at the heart of the menu. Mr. Anderer turns the legs of his suckling pigs into soft braised meat for a perfect pasta dish of torn shreds of malfatti mixed with arugula, nutty and sweet. The feet (no restaurant in Manhattan in 2010 fails to find room for feet!) are fried into delicate little appetizers, with beans and celery beneath them."
,"The rest of the animal, meanwhile, is slow-roasted then cut into portions. Loin, belly, ribs and shoulder, these become the restaurant\u2019s centerpiece meal, maialino al forno, which appears only to be listed as a special to avoid having a $72 entree on a menu that otherwise tops out at $32. The skin, blasted to crisp in a hot oven, is dusted in rosemary, cracked fennel, salt and pepper: an apparently unambitious preparation that tastes just great - pork at its best. Over roasted potatoes, the dish can serve three with ease."
,"Maialino al forno is a sorry-grateful, regretful-happy way to eat dinner. It leaves a diner panting a little, ready for sleep."
,"Have a slice of olive oil cake, like a poundcake just back from a junior year abroad, and you\u2019ll barely make the cab. Better to revive yourself on the back of a simple affogato, vanilla ice cream drowned in espresso, or with the spirits of a strong grappa that cuts through all that maialino."
,"Was New York City a better place when there were sad old men sitting at the bar in the lobby of the Gramercy alongside stooped former artist\u2019s models, with smoke curling up toward the ceiling on exhalations of gin breath and despair?"
,"Probably not. But the era is worth recalling as you sit at Maialino, drinking prosecco or coffee and looking south toward Gramercy Park as cabs inch past."
,"Yes, the impetus for change here was Mr. Schrager\u2019s hotel. But it is Mr. Meyer who has brought New Yorkers to the room, to the view, back to the neighborhood. His restaurants have almost always done this in some way. They encourage their customers to appreciate what sits outside them, to rediscover Manhattan in the process. They direct attention to architecture, to parks, to the ideals of urban life. Mr. Meyer has changed the city with restaurants. Isn\u2019t that something?"

"IN the imaginary New York of first novels and romantic comedies, there is often a restaurant like Marc Forgione, a brick-walled neighborhood spot glittering with candlelight and the promise of a third date going well."
,"The restaurant is rustic and urban at once, a loft that might be in a town farther up the Hudson River. A long bar sits to the west, with a warm, rough-hewn dining room beside it. A couple sits at the corner table under mirrors, eating crisp chicken in a gleaming black pan, the meat sitting on top of golden potatoes draped with verdant broccoli rabe. In real life, they kiss."
,"Around them sit other couples, young families, people on their way to that state. Later, the scene will shift toward off-work analysts from the counting houses nearby, local rou\u00E9s at the bar and shy visitors peeking at them over glasses of savagnin. Service is warm and practiced, the food about three times better than it needs to be."
,"Marc Forgione, which opened two years ago on Reade Street just west of Hudson Street, is a model neighborhood restaurant in a neighborhood that has no shortage of them. Named for its chef, a partner in the enterprise with Christopher Blumlo, it was known as Forge when it opened, but a lawsuit threatened by the owner of a Miami restaurant of the same name forced a change in 2009."
,"There are elements of Italian cooking on the freewheeling and often-changing menu, and French and Southeast Asian notes as well. You might start with a hiramasa tartare with avocado and Sichuan buttons, flower buds with a fiery, numbing taste, then move on to scallops in a Thai curry, and finish with pumpkin pie. Really, you might."
,"Mr. Forgione\u2019s food is sometimes sweet. Other times, it is salty, sour or spicy. Sometimes it is all four - and loudly so. The brashness is deeply and above all American: an augmentation of international cuisines in a land of plenty."
,"These menu predilections will come as no surprise to those who follow the bloodlines of professional kitchens. Mr. Forgione is a son of Larry Forgione, a precursor to the celebrity chefs of today whose cooking was so linked to the notion of a national cuisine that his flagship restaurant, founded in 1983, was called An American Place."
,"Mr. Forgione the younger continues the family tradition."
,"Recently there has been on his appetizer menu a dish called barbecued oysters, a riff on an old Paul Prudhomme recipe. Mr. Forgione naps four oysters in a Cajun b\u00E9chamel, with a little bit of pepper-jack cheese and a dot of barbecue sauce, then runs them under the high heat of an industrial broiler. With a dusting of fiery spice powder - Ararat blend, from La Bo&#238;te \u00E0 Epice - these come to the table in the manner of a postcard from Chartres Street, New Orleans."
,"They taste of time travel, of a realization that sometimes the future lies in the past. Baked oysters under b\u00E9chamel. With cheese! We might have forgotten all about that, those of us who generally sit in the sort of restaurants where people take pictures of their food. Two orders for four people would not be a mistake."
,"Also on the appetizer menu: a TriBeCa take on Singaporean chili-crab, with the crabs swapped out for little cull lobsters cut into delicate bites, and the steamed buns that generally accompany the dish replaced with buttery Texas toast. The lobster swims in a fiery sauce of sriracha and butter, ginger, soy sauce and lobster stock, with a faint zing of lime juice. And what seems like really quite a lot of the stuff when the dish first arrives proves just enough for mop up with the bread at the end."
,"Wait, these are just appetizers? Yes, and more of them follow, big boys with grace, as if they were Hells Angels dancing a jig."
,"There is a kind of mac and cheese, for instance, with toasted orzo and gamy bits of lamb neck, marscapone flecked with black pepper and mint, and a garlicky crust of bread crumbs and melted Parmesan: a haute stoner\u2019s reward. Also, a BLT salad that took up the very end of the summer\u2019s tomato season, with beautiful fruit cut into fat dice, with long, crisp bits of fried pigs\u2019 ears and a smoked onion r\u00E9moulade in the role of - what, mayonnaise, bread, both? (Who cares!)"
,"And perhaps best of all: a bowl of peppery gnocchi in a sauce of demi-glace keeping company with matchsticks of apple, micro-celery and knuckle-hunks of veal sausage made lively with coriander. Just like grandma\u2019s."
,"Main courses mostly steer closer to the center of the channel. But some, though not all, are quite good. (Scallops in a \"lobster-Thai curry emulsion\" ran hard aground.)"
,"The suddenly fashionable beef cut known as flatiron steak (it is the top portion of a cow\u2019s shoulder, a steak that commercial butchers only recently figured out how to harvest effectively) was excellent, arriving on a wide plate with rich Maytag cheese butter and bordelaise sauce, along with chanterelles and black kale, its marbled meat tangy beside its sweet, salty accompaniments."
,"Rounds of striped bass came wrapped in thin bacon, with mustard greens, cranberry beans and a soft, elegant broth. Mr. Forgione had deep-fried bits of the skin to make a kind of popcorn garnish for the dish. The texture raised the entire preparation higher."
,"He paired a bit of pork tenderloin with pork belly and deep-fried nuggets of pig cheek, along with clams and matsutake mushrooms, then dusted the dish with black garlic powder so that it had a mysterious, almost smoky finish. This worked nicely as well."
,"Mr. Forgione also excels at simplicity, however: That crisp, golden chicken with potatoes and broccoli rabe, cooked under a brick and served in that big black iron pan, is the restaurant\u2019s best dish. The whole mess sits above a run of caper-shallot butter, dressed with chili flakes and parsley, and if it were a record you\u2019d want to play it again and again."
,"Eat it after a plate of those barbecued oysters, with a bottle of one of the restaurant\u2019s big and fairly priced California reds, then finish with a dessert from Mr. Forgione\u2019s pastry chef, Ashton Warren - a banana-split sundae, for instance, with fried banana and lots of chocolate."
,"This all may leave you feeling a little rough in the morning. But you\u2019ll be back, American."

"THIS recession\u2019s over. At least that\u2019s the message the knights in white broadcloth are sending out at Marea, the elegant Italianate restaurant Chris Cannon and Michael White opened this spring in the space on Central Park South that used to be San Domenico. Cue the prosecco. Take a look at that Dover sole!"
,"Here is Sumner Redstone scowling at shadows. There is Henry Kravis sitting like Dorian Gray. Everyone between them looks low-slung and comfortable in butter-soft chairs, 125 of them, with the M104 bus swinging by the plate-glass windows up front, street lights shifting into red against the distant darkness of Central Park. It is all very pleasant and warm: rosewood on the walls; silver-dipped conches and nautiluses on the window sills. That bar back is honey onyx."
,"Restaurants are culture as sure as music or paintings. They say something about who we are. So never mind the bold-faced names, those old familiar faces. Civilized people on the subway home from the Met talk about opera, not who has seats in the parterre box. Marea says, settle down. When the market was low, we spent like crazies and now look wise. You like to eat? Watch what is going to happen to you."
,"The very first item on the menu at Marea is ricci, a piece of warm toast slathered with sea urchin roe, blanketed in a thin sheet of lardo, and dotted with sea salt. It offers exactly the sensation as kissing an extremely attractive person for the first time - a bolt of surprise and pleasure combined. The salt and fat give way to primal sweetness and combine in deeply agreeable ways. The feeling lingers on the tongue and vibrates through the body. Not bad at $14 a throw - and there are two on each plate."
,"Mr. White arrived in New York in 2002 as the chef at Fiamma in SoHo, and showed himself to be an extraordinary practitioner of pasta. (At the unlovely Vento in the meatpacking district, he made a mean veal trotter.) Later, he teamed up with Mr. Cannon to make Alto a shrine to northern Italian food and L\u2019Impero, now Convivio, a gallery for the best of that nation\u2019s south. He cooks Italian food as if it were purely American: big and bold."
,"While Marea is a seafood restaurant, it is not one that seeks to place a divide between that which swims and that which walks. It is perhaps more accurate to call it a restaurant inspired by seafood - but by no means in thrall to it."
,"Halibut arrives with a little more lardo mixed in with its retinue of Manila clams, sweet corn and spigarelli (like a mild broccoli rabe), and a chili oil that might as well be fresh-squeezed sopressata. Fusilli come with a sauce made of octopus braised in red wine - and thickened by bone marrow. The marrow would be gild on a lily if it weren\u2019t so flavorful, a more neutral demi-glace that is the perfect pairing for (who knew!) octopus."
,"And the restaurant\u2019s one beef offering, a sirloin from the terrific Creekstone Farms outfit, dry-aged 50 days, grilled rare and served with more of that marrow cut into a bread salad, would do epic battle with the beef at any steakhouse in town."
,"But we get ahead of ourselves. The menu at Marea is divided into sections; diners may order a four-course meal for $89, plus perhaps a few add-ons for the table. That ricci, for instance, or a zeppole made of seaweed, shrimp and chickpeas that ought to be what people get when they order zeppole at street fairs."
,"There is as well a crudo menu - and a crudo bar along the restaurant\u2019s east side, with seats for 20. It is not part of the prix fixe, but a geoduck clam with fresh chilies and lemon helps explain in one bite why men would dive amid huge swells to retrieve the things from the angry Pacific. You might also visit with the tuna and creamy (though creamless) oyster crema, with crisp bits of artichoke, or a hunk of striped bass acting as pack animal for a load of sturgeon caviar, drizzled in mussel vinaigrette."
,"Mr. White treats antipasti as character studies. Knuckles of lobster arrive commingled with torn hunks of burrata cheese, the creaminess of both (literal in the case of the cheese, figurative on the part of the lobster) melding into eggplant cooked down as if it were mushrooms, with a grassy hit of basil on top. Monkfish cheeks orbit a slow-poached egg with a loamy mushroom rag\u00F9."
,"Worthwhile pastas, in addition to the fusilli, include a rich spaghetti with crab, sea urchin and basil. There is sweet cavatelli with red shrimp, controne-bean pur\u00E9e and rosemary, a loose cotechino sausage cut into risotto, silky with melted cod belly. You may pass on the seppia and shrimp rag\u00F9, mysterious as it is; cuttlefish, also part of an unexciting grilled main course, are not up to the treatments Mr. White puts them through."
,"The main courses -secondi di pesce, the menu calls them - are the restaurant\u2019s weakness. After the brilliance of the appetizer course and the winning flavors of those pastas, it is difficult to maintain focus on an architectural marvel involving porcini-dusted sea scallops. Adriatic seafood soup is laden with what might be the entire window display at Citarella. Too much."
,"Better to hit shore for the steak (or a crisp roast guinea hen with asparagus) or upgrade into the whole-fish treatments: a few simply grilled langoustines, for instance, paired with a salsa verde, or that Dover sole with lemon. You want a simple sentence after the complex ones."
,"Wine? You ought to have lots. Mr. Cannon has, with Francesco Grosso, conceived a fascinating, lengthy list. It may run unfamiliar to nonobsessives: lots of bracing whites heavy on coastal terroir, light reds good with fish. If you follow the Mark Bittman principle, which argues that the best way to order wine is to give the sommelier a price point and a challenge to match the bottle to the table\u2019s order, you ought to do well. Service at the restaurant is superb: helpful, friendly and apron-clad rather than black-tied and imperious. (Also knowing: I was dining anonymously, but was recognized at the door.)"
,"Heather Bertinetti is Marea\u2019s pastry chef. She doesn\u2019t fool around. Hers is a rich torrone gelato with black cocoa cake; she makes a mean crisp-polenta number with blackberry compote. Order the affogato, though, for maximum wow: a float of zabaglione gelato with small pours of espresso and amaro on top. This is iced coffee for the smart set, fantastic to eat and drink."
,"Marea is an ambitious restaurant, more so than any Mr. Cannon and Mr. White have opened. It is also in many ways a casual one, unfussy, as welcoming as a luxe clubhouse. It is not cheap nor meant to be. Art in Manhattan can be like that. Life is balance. You read the notices for \"Bye Bye Birdie\" on Broadway? Better dinner here than tickets there, plus what you\u2019d spend at Sardi\u2019s for cannelloni and vodka."

"ONE of Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s newest ventures is a tangle of given names called the Mark Restaurant by Jean-Georges, in the Mark Hotel on East 77th Street. It lies behind a small bar filled with low-slung pony-skin chairs. Older men unsure of how they\u2019re going to get out of them sit there, pondering the issue over vodka as cubs and cougars banter and text. Dinner seems unlikely."
,"Past them, though, down a dark corridor that doubles as a modernist wine cellar, a very good restaurant blooms."
,"Local burghers sit in the dining rooms alongside tight-faced matrons in vintage Halston, younger ones in diamonds and black pencil skirts. There are senior partners from white-shoe firms; publishing tycoons; one of the city\u2019s premier public relations men, fiddling with an immense gold ring."
,"One table the other night held a foursome openly gawking at Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn, who were settling into a table. A few evenings later, Paul McCartney and friends would be in their place, his knightship in sneakers."
,"All were eating plainly as they sat on heavy, plush chairs under soft and flattering light, their faces glowing against the beige background, the whole earth-tone Mondrian scene of the Mark: comfortable as wealth itself. There were austere roasted meats and saut\u00E9ed fish on some tables, hamburgers on another. There were Caesar salads, plates of simple pasta, bowls of soup."
,"Conversation burbled along in the room like a stream swollen with snowmelt. There was occasional laughter. It is all very cheery in the Mark by Jean-Georges."
,"Mr. Vongerichten himself has been present, on and off, standing by the passage to the kitchen, his hands clasped in front of his waist, dressed in crisp kitchen whites. What he sees before him surely matches the prospectus he offered the newly renovated hotel: a neighborhood restaurant for a neighborhood sorely lacking in neighborhood restaurants, with the prospect of hotel guests as insurance against those periods when the neighborhood is in Palm Beach or Paris, Nantucket or Gstaad."
,"He turned on his heel the other night and disappeared. Perhaps he was heading downtown to look in on ABC Kitchen, the restaurant he just opened on East 18th Street. Or perhaps he was catching a flight. Mr. Vongerichten has 27 other properties operating under or near his name, from New York to Doha, Hong Kong to the Bahamas. He is a busy fellow."
,"The menu at the Mark is a smart hedge against the possibility that his inattention would lead to a drop-off in quality there. It is so unambitious that it is difficult to fumble, at least as long as Pierre Schutz, a loyal Vongerichten lieutenant for decades who serves as the restaurant\u2019s chef de cuisine, is there to keep a close eye on the plates."
,"That doesn\u2019t make it a bad menu. Four perfectly golden scallops, dressed only in salt and pepper, are a buttery, rich delight, enhanced by a small dab of a pink, sriracha-enhanced mixture of egg yolks, grapeseed oil, kombu seaweed water and orange and lime juice. This is served in a small bowl to the side and comes with all the \"simply grilled\" proteins, a separate category of the menu. Only the uncouth would call it mayonnaise."
,"\"The chef is known for his spices,\" a waiter said one night, extolling the excellent lamb chops off that list. \"These simply prepared items are for people who might be a little worried about that.\" (Service at the restaurant is professional, if more casual than at the restaurant\u2019s only real competitor in the neighborhood, Daniel Boulud\u2019s renovated Caf\u00E9 Boulud.)"
,"Caesar salad has been chopped into submission and dressed for a ball at the embassy, where anchovies are unwelcome, but a bowl of linguine served with cockles and parsley, slightly fiery in its salty, rich broth, is worth praising, even if it\u2019s a recipe that riffs off one Mr. Vongerichten has cooked for years, and that appears in one of his cookbooks."
,"Also recycled, pleasantly, is the pea soup, a pur\u00E9e of sweet green peas that taste of springtime and have the smooth texture of high-thread-count sheets; a version of it exists on the tasting menu at Jean Georges, Mr. Vongerichten\u2019s four-star flagship near Columbus Circle. Blend in the accompanying cloud of Parmesan foam, and it\u2019s like a lover sliding into bed: nice."
,"An immodest little pizza of black truffles and fontina is an elegant and delicious take on the sort of puff-crusted pies Mathieu Palombino makes at Motorino, and worth a run through the excellent and deep wine list to find a pinot noir from Au Bon Climat to drink with it. Pizza at a Vongerichten restaurant? This one is exactly the sort to thrill a couple who hasn\u2019t had a pizza since that time they needed to get takeout because there was a wreck on the Saw Mill up near where Hawthorne Circle used to be, and they didn\u2019t get home from Tanglewood until nearly 9."
,"And there is much to enjoy in the barely steamed shrimp salad with avocado and enoki mushrooms, dressed in a filmy Champagne dressing. The shrimp is slack and velvety against the firm, slick flesh of the avocado, as the nutty enoki bridges the two; it\u2019s a magic trick of a dish. As is a fat cake of sweet peekytoe crab enlivened by ginger, with more avocado and lobes of pink grapefruit. It is as unmistakably Vongerichten\u2019s as his fingerprint. A grilled veal chop served over rhubarb, peas and a spring onion fondue, meanwhile, is a pleasure worth gnawing, though doing so can draw stares in this room."
,"So chicken with a Parmesan crust is a golden misfire, and a split roasted lobster with warm mushroom dressing is more self-indulgent than good. And so the cheeseburger, with its black-truffle dressing and melting Brie, falls into this camp as well. (It has a terrific pickle on it, though.) Erik Hubert, the pastry chef, will win hearts and minds with his cloudlike Grand Marnier souffl\u00E9 and green-tea opera cake."
,"Mr. Vongerichten\u2019s great genius used to be how he used the spare aesthetics of Asian cooking to improve classical French cuisine. Then it became how he used the lessons of that experience to raid other larders, and to create steakhouses and street-food emporia, Japanese noodle bars and market-driven French bistros."
,"Now he opens hotel restaurants all over the world. This one is hardly a risk. But it is a welcome addition to the Upper East Side."

"ANOTHER year, another restaurant keeping up its end of the bargain in an awkward hotel lobby space."
,"Millesime is a smart young French establishment from the talented chef Laurent Manrique. It is spread out over the back of the second floor of the Carlton Hotel on Madison Avenue and 29th Street, where Country was once strong. The entrance sits at the intersection of two lounges that lie off the hotel\u2019s sunken lobby: Salon Millesime, where you may run into a woman playing a lighted accordion, or see a Michael Jackson impersonator perform (really!); and the dark and comfortable Bar Millesime, which could easily appear in divorce papers as the location where plaintiff\u2019s husband initiated the commission of an act of adultery."
,"Visitors to Millesime the restaurant must first walk down a staircase, then through one or both of these spaces, to find themselves, perhaps confused and hesitant by this point, at the start of another staircase that leads up. The dining room lies at its end: Millesime, at last."
,"It is not particularly promising, all this walking and climbing through other businesses to get to the one where you have reserved a table. (And what\u2019s with the name? Millesime is French for \"vintage,\" as in wine, though the restaurant does not use the accent that, in France, would appear over the first \"e,\" nor the one that in some uses appears over the second. The resulting pronunciation - \"Mill-ah-seem,\" \"Mill-EY-zeem\" - is up to you.) Crowds have as yet been sparse."
,"But, holy cats, is there a beautiful, even exciting brasserie up there at the end of the journey, a restaurant devoted to the pleasures of the sea that manages to be luxurious and humble, ambitious and rustic, all at once."
,"The room has red banquettes and tile floors and soaring walls that lead toward a Tiffany-style dome ceiling. There is white paper on the tables, and glinting little Eiffel Towers of salt and pepper, small galvanized buckets holding napkin-wrapped heavy silverware, all in beautiful light. The atmosphere is festive and urban, pleasant in the extreme. Waiters bustle this way and that in long aprons and black vests as Samy Kebbab, the restaurant\u2019s effusive and seemingly omnipresent ma&#238;tre d\u2019h\u00F4tel, rushes that way and this, managing the room as if it were a party - a master of the hotel, in the truest sense of the term."
,"Eat, eat! There is marvelous bread with a butter cut with red wine and shallots. Mr. Manrique serves an outstanding appetizer of smoked herring placed on warm, glistening fingerling potatoes. He offers a silken grilled Caesar salad, with melting hearts of romaine wrapped with soft, smoky black cod, with a dusting of Parmesan and a squeeze of lime. There are bracing platters of oysters and clams, and of remarkable tartares that manage to evoke classical traditions in some preparations (a sweetly briny mixture of salmon and mustard, dill and fennel) and new ones in others (tuna cut with dates and mint, against a fiery Berber spice mixture)."
,"Steamed mussels achieve much the same trick. Mr. Manrique offers a standard bistro concoction of white wine, parsley and shallots, and another that ramps south to Marseilles with a Pernod broth flavored with saffron and fennel. A third option involves curry powder, apples, lime and coconut bouillon. It would be a treasure of the American South if there were mussels in Charleston Harbor; it is country captain, essentially, and exciting for that."
,"Mr. Manrique was for a number of years the chef at the renowned Aqua, in San Francisco (those who\u2019ve been following the food game in New York long enough may remember him from Peacock Alley in the Waldorf-Astoria, back in the early 1990s). His menus have been slick and inventive. But he was taught in a very old school."
,"So, distinguished pike quenelles appear, as well, served in a lobster sauce of great depth. These are far larger than the ones you\u2019ll find at those few elegant French restaurants that still serve them (La Grenouille comes to mind), but very much of a piece with their work: what Julia Child called \"this delicate triumph of French cooking.\" Mr. Manrique credits them to the style of the New York chef Jean-Louis Dumonet. And there is an outstanding dish of poached eggs, briny clams and salty French ham, a liquid breakfast sandwich, and as satisfying."
,"Entrees bring a moment of pause: five species of fish, only vaguely identified (salmon, cod, black sea bass, snapper, tuna), that may be grilled or cooked on the hot griddle known as a plancha. To go with them, sauce: five choices again, ranging from a simple and technically perfect meuni\u00E8re to a gingery beurre blanc made with Juran&#231;on wine. These are all expertly prepared, if a little boring after the first-course fireworks. (Save for a marvelous toasted brioche with Armagnac ice cream, the desserts follow suit: profiteroles, etc. Sigh.)"
,"A steak for two is neither good enough nor frankly large enough to justify its $86 price tag, even with an extra dollop of shallots plopped down around the meat. And duck confit cut into a macaroni gratin is simple fatty ridiculousness, a cheap nod at the city\u2019s fashion for excessive cuisine."
,"But Mr. Manrique - or his executive chef, Alan Ashkinaze - can cook a roast chicken to beautiful, burnished perfection, and serve it with a gravy rich with garlic, with a fragrant mist of thyme. And there surely cannot be a better deal or package of lobster flavor than the restaurant\u2019s $48 pot au feu, which brings two people a fat lobster to share, with plump little lobster sausages and a heady, cream-heavy broth."
,"Millesime has opened in a city where restaurant tastes have lately been running Italian, and hard. But its earnest young servers toil under Mr. Kebbab to emulate a version of the scene you used to be able to find at brasseries all over Manhattan. (Ah, Jean-Jacques Rachou, we miss you so.) There is some of that energy, and verve."
,"The restaurant serves as a swell reminder of why this city fell in love with brasseries in the first place, and as a hopeful sign that there could be a resurgence in that affair. See if you can find your way there."

"title": "Momofuku Ssam Bar Takes Serious Strides in Food, but Keeps Its Casual Feel",
"byline": "By FRANK BRUNI",
"pubdate": "2008-12-02T23:03:56-0500",

"IF you\u2019ve had just about all of the fawning over David Chang that you can take, think about how those of us dishing out the praise feel. We\u2019d love to move on to a more original object of adoration and would be happy to pronounce him overrated or just plain over - we\u2019re cranky and contrary that way."
,"But he won\u2019t let us. He keeps demanding more from himself and his restaurants, keeps giving us reasons not to stray. Exhibit A: Momofuku Ssam Bar, the cornerstone of the Chang legend."
,"It opened in the summer of 2006 and before its first birthday established itself as the go-to, drop-in mess hall for enlightened food lovers on all budgets at all hours, its menu a relatively unstructured collection of small and large dishes, its kitchen open well past midnight on weekend nights, its backless stools doled out on a first-come-first-served basis."
,"It justly enshrined Mr. Chang as a chef who went further than any of his peers in wedding serious, sometimes challenging food and an ultra-casual, spontaneous dining ethos in tune with unbound times. And it no more wanted for business than it did for acclaim."
,"Mr. Chang might have let Ssam Bar coast from there. He had other projects to tend to: the relocation and expansion of Momofuku Noodle Bar; the openings of Momofuku Ko and, just weeks ago, Momofuku Bakery and Milk Bar, an annex of Ssam with a major sweet tooth."
,"But bit by bit and month by month, he tinkered."
,"When I gave Ssam two stars in The New York Times in February 2007, it had only a smattering of wines. Now it has about 200, smartly and creatively chosen."
,"Back in early 2007 its only dessert was a mochi ice cream sampler. Now it has three choices, courtesy of the ascendant pastry whiz Christina Tosi, who deftly integrates salty and sweet by adding Gorgonzola to a pear sorbet and, in another dessert, sandwiching a saltine panna cotta between peanut butter pastry and a Concord grape sauce. If those aren\u2019t enough, you can toddle down a short passageway to Milk Bar, get a cookie or a slice of pie, and eat it, standing, at one of the counters there."
,"The late-summer renovation that created Milk Bar also reconfigured Ssam, now graced with a better layout and about 70 stools, up from 55 before."
,"In addition, Ssam has expanded its daytime offerings, which until recently focused on Asian burritos. Now more than half of the dinner menu is available at lunch, and Ssam has abandoned the burritos, which were long its least successful items."
,"But these advances aren\u2019t my only prompts to reappraise it."
,"In the last year and a half, I\u2019ve found myself returning to Ssam again and again, and not just because new dishes regularly appear - that happens elsewhere, too - or because its steamed buns with pork belly remain the city\u2019s most perfect finger food."
,"I\u2019ve circled back because eating at Ssam feels so unencumbered, honest and joyful, and because I can\u2019t stop reflecting on the daring and importance of Mr. Chang\u2019s work there."
,"Yes, he and his team of skilled helpers demonstrate greater finesse and more culinary ambition at Ko, designed to be the polished, precious Momofuku. But you expect nothing less than excellence from a restaurant with just 12 coveted stools and a no-choice, multicourse tasting menu that lasts two hours and costs $100."
,"At freewheeling Ssam, you can drop in for just 30 minutes, have a snack of one or two small dishes, pay just $20 for them. And yet the quality of the food - its fastidious sourcing, vibrant seasoning and ingenious grace notes - isn\u2019t dumbed down in the least for an informal context."
,"Ssam\u2019s best raw fish compositions are on a painterly par with Esca\u2019s. The whole pork butt - meant to be eaten by six or more people - is a pigout as fatty and fantastic as any great barbecue joint\u2019s."
,"Such disparate options don\u2019t usually appear on the same menu, but Mr. Chang trusts diners not to be disoriented by an assortment of dishes without any instantly clear theme or overriding ethnic allegiance - by platters of artisanal American hams next to a tangle of Sichuan-style beef tendon alongside a hanger steak with a romesco sauce. He pulls off this eclecticism, which could easily lapse into incoherence, by keeping the menu sufficiently succinct and making sure everything on it counts."
,"No dish comes across as a compulsory sop to unadventurous eaters or an obligatory nod to some trend. It seems, instead, that Mr. Chang & Co. are simply feeding you what they themselves most enjoy eating."
,"Usually that means pork, which pops up in some form in more than a third of the dishes. Often that means offal, clearly one of his passions, reflected in the terrific panko-crusted, deep-fried pig\u2019s head torchon on the current menu."
,"But sometimes it just means a crunchy baguette with a cow\u2019s milk butter from Vermont and a goat\u2019s milk butter from Britain. Ssam charges $8 for this, rightly wagering that if you really value bread and butter, you\u2019d rather pay for something superior than get something ordinary for free."
,"Seemingly straightforward dishes harbor attention-getting surprises, like the Dijon spaetzle with slices of duck in a relatively new entree that\u2019s outstanding, though not as outstanding as the crisp-edged pork blade steak dressed with buttermilk, pickled ramp juice and Kewpie mayonnaise."
,"Not all the surprises are created equal. A pumpkin chawan mushi studded with chunks of Grana Padano cheese deserves more points for seasonality and originality than for out-and-out appeal."
,"And Ssam has irritations. There\u2019s no hot coffee or hot tea, and that seems less an interesting aesthetic choice than a stubborn mannerism in light of their unavailability, too, at Milk Bar, which is open for breakfast."
,"The wait for a stool can be long and the music very loud and a meal\u2019s pace fleeter than you desire."
,"But those realities amount to a dining idiom that suits many circumstances better than a more conventionally coddling one - and that\u2019s every bit as valid. With Ssam, Mr. Chang has made as confident and compelling a case for that as any New York chef."

"THERE was a television crew in Motorino in Williamsburg a couple of weeks ago, Michelle Park from NY1 shooting a segment with the restaurant\u2019s chef, the elegant young Mathieu Palombino. He smiled shyly in chef\u2019s whites."
,"There have been others. Fame stalks the restaurant, which has locations in Brooklyn and the East Village. Vice magazine came to film an episode of its \"Munchies\" program, which streams on VBS.tv. Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli, who run the Frankies restaurants and Prime Meats out of a compound in Carroll Gardens, were the ostensible subjects, but they ventured to Motorino to eat pizza. They ended up spiriting Mr. Palombino back to their lair to make meatballs."
,"Even the upstate media personality Rachael Ray has gotten in on the Motorino act, publishing Ed Levine\u2019s and Adam Kuban\u2019s lunatic cross-country pizza competition, a bracket-style run-up to the announcement of America\u2019s best pizza, in the March issue of Every Day With Rachael Ray. (Motorino won in the eastern division; Pizzeria Bianco, in Phoenix, took the national title.) Ms. Ray is in the East Village outpost of the restaurant \"far too often,\" she told The Daily News."
,"Motorino is having a moment. That seems fair. It serves the city\u2019s best pizza."
,"It does so consistently, at both locations, whether Mr. Palombino is cooking or not. Made to his specifications and cooked in the tempering heat of a wood fire, his crust emerges from the oven as a Neapolitan fantasy of crispness that is also pillowy and soft, sweet but not sugared, tangy without too much salt."
,"Multiple visits to the restaurants confirm: Motorino pies are great hot out of the oven, 5 minutes later, 10. You can order too much, watch a pie go cool on the plate, eat it anyway and discover: terrific."
,"You can order pizzas to take out, drive them across the boroughs in freezing conditions, get home and reheat the pies: still terrific. Even a slice in the morning, fridge-cooled mozzarella over tangy red sauce, exhibits the pliancy and flavor of bread, not cardboard."
,"Pizza has been a big deal in New York since the first slice was folded. It has been a big deal in the upper reaches of the New York restaurant world since at least 2004, when places like Franny\u2019s in Prospect Heights and Una Pizza Napoletana in the East Village first fired up their ovens at the dawn of the artisanal pizza age."
,"There has been slippage since. Anthony Mangieri, the obsessive behind Una Pizza Napoletana, sold his space to Mr. Palombino last year and moved to San Francisco."
,"Fads fade. And rise again. Later this year Keith McNally will open a pizzeria on the Bowery, Pulino\u2019s, with Nate Appleman, lately of A16 in San Francisco. The debut is likely to be attended by some fanfare. Mr. McNally is to restaurant publicity as Emanuel Ax is to his Steinway."
,"Motorino kept chugging along. And in the process, it became something more than an excellent pizzeria. It became a good restaurant."
,"Of the two locations, the one in the East Village, small and built by Mr. Mangieri, is the less hospitable, though this does nothing to the quality of the pies. It is a narrow East Village storefront, with hard angles everywhere and an atmosphere that runs ever so slightly in the direction of an ice cream parlor."
,"You can find a $175 Amarone on its wine list, which has been curated by Fred Dexheimer, a former BLT sommelier. To order it would be to render oneself a cartoon. Motorino is a good restaurant. It\u2019s not that good."
,"Better to take the L train the three stops into Brooklyn and enjoy the benefits of Kings County real estate: a large high-ceilinged room with warm incandescent lighting over wooden floors and soft-hued marble, the scent of the wood oven and the taste, against a cold Peroni, of transcendent pizza."
,"A restaurant is more than a pizzeria, of course. Mr. Palombino, Belgian-born and a product of some of the city\u2019s best high-ticket restaurants (for a time he ran the kitchen at BLT Fish), appears to understand that well. A meal in his restaurants does more than result in simply a Homerish mmm-good sigh at the quality of the margherita pie."
,"(But, wow, that margherita pie is good: perfect-pitch dough with exactly the correct ratios of tomato to cheese to surface area to char to bubble and flat.)"
,"Mr. Palombino has put thought into appetizers: a wonderfully bright and flavorful farro salad, say; or a small plate of baby spinach and prosciutto spun together with stracciatella so that it becomes a new take on creamed spinach; or a plate of nutty, rich, fire-roasted mortadella that could serve as the explanation for the inclusion of fried bologna in the good-food hall of fame."
,"His beet salad has a little red onion for acidity, some boiled egg for base, a little white anchovy for salt and tang, and ricotta salata to keep everyone cool. The dish never loses focus. It is a paragon of beet salad. (But he isn\u2019t a god. His spicy roasted octopus and potato on East 12th Street tastes neither spicy nor roasted.)"
,"The margherita is Motorino\u2019s baseline dish. Mr. Palombino provides two, one attached to an AOC designation as if it were a product of Naples. It features buffalo mozzarella along with tomatoes and basil. The regular uses plain old cow\u2019s milk cheese. Both are outstanding."
,"But a winter-special pie of brussels sprouts and smoked pancetta, dressed with mozzarella, garlic and pecorino, is like something from a magic act, a dog speaking BBC English. It is great and unsettling, far better than imagination would dictate."
,"A cremini mushroom and spicy sausage pie, with smoked scamorza cheese, garlic, thyme and pecorino, arrives at the table ever so slightly watery, a little off-putting. Within five minutes it heals itself, and thus rewards the wait before eating."
,"Choose white or red: a stracciatella pie, the cheese melted into the dough with patches of basil on top, with a drizzle of olive oil and a dusting of sea salt, grilled cheese for grown-ups; or a filetti one, with mozzarella, cherry tomatoes and a welcome bit of thyme that recalls the soft warmth of southern France."
,"For dessert, there are bombolini - essentially jelly doughnuts, and delicious. These are a curiosity, as eccentric, welcome and interesting as Mr. Palombino himself: a celebrity chef who cooks pizza, a talented restaurateur who meets his modest goals with grace and wit."

"THE butter-poached lobster almost did it, but not quite. I had been wooed with succulent lobster before. The Island Creek oysters and Iranian caviar, mingled in a kind of sabayon that I was served during that same dinner and during others, made a seductive case. But I was wary of such ostentation."
,"In the end, it was a different night and a nine-course vegetable tasting, of all things, that made me drop any reserve, cast aside any doubts and accept the fact that I loved Per Se - and that this preening, peacock-vain newcomer deserved it."
,"I ordered the meal out of a sense of duty, with a heavy heart. Jicama ribbons? Warm potato salad? How transcendent could those be?"
,"Silly, cynical, carnivorous me. The jicama was sensational, so packed with moisture and so faintly sweet that it could have been a new, undiscovered fruit, and the cilantro and avocado that came with it were like idealized essences of themselves, so flavorful that they seemed to have been cultivated in a more verdant universe. The bite-size marble potatoes in the potato salad popped like grapes in my mouth, and an exquisitely balanced mustard-seed vinaigrette gave them a subtle zing."
,"Lobster is easy; potato salad is hard. And a restaurant that turns a summer picnic staple into a meal-stopping, sigh-inducing dish - and makes that dish a legitimate course in a $135 tasting menu - cannot be denied. Per Se is wondrous."
,"It is not wondrous 100 percent of the time, and it can be maddening: at moments too intent on culinary adventure or too highfalutin in its presentation and descriptions of dishes, one of which came with a choice of four salts from three continents. To get a reservation may well require a degree of planning and effort that verge on masochistic, and a multicourse, mini-portion extravaganza may well require four hours, which is more time than many diners have or want to spend."
,"But here is the thing: the return on that patience and that investment is more than a few mouthfuls of food that instantaneously bring a crazy smile to your face and lodge in your memory for days and even weeks to come."
,"My no-meat meal (with plenty of eggs, cheese and butter) went on to include a creamy but correctly firm risotto that was anointed with a decadently generous mound of summer truffles from Provence. I shared the dish, so I had only eight bites. A month and half later, I still remember the first of those, and how insanely happy it made me, and the last, and how ineffably sad I was."
,"Yes, yes: Per Se suffers somewhat by comparison with the French Laundry. That is the Napa Valley restaurant where Thomas Keller, the chef at Per Se, made his reputation as one of the most talented American cooks of his generation and created a culinary Mecca, drawing worshipful pilgrims from near and far. Per Se is Mr. Keller's attempt, amid dauntingly great expectations, to recreate that magic in New York, a city that failed him (or that he failed) earlier in his career."
,"An exact replica is impossible. After several visits to Per Se, I traveled to Napa for a night and ate at the French Laundry. It inhabits a 19th-century house among vineyards and rolling hills, and that setting dilutes the starched formality of a prolonged meal. It also emphasizes the kitchen's connection to the land around it. Ask a waiter at the French Laundry where a vegetable on your plate came from, and he or she will likely say, \"Across the street.\""
,"Per Se is across the street from Central Park, in what is essentially a shopping mall. With its brown tones, dark woods and shimmering metal surfaces, it looks like a gilded corporate boardroom, not just touched but kissed by Midas. It offers opulence in place of hominess: an appropriate adjustment, I would argue, from Napa to Manhattan."
,"It also feels blissfully indulgent. The space between tables - only 16 of them - is vast, and every table has a view of the park and the grand buildings that skirt it. If you can wangle a reservation that puts you in Per Se around dusk and allows you to watch the light fade over Manhattan, do it. The reward is a profound sense of peace that very few of this frenetic city's restaurants can offer."
,"I am handicapped slightly in evaluating the service, because the vigilant staff repeatedly recognized me, and kept a special watch over my table. But I, in turn, kept watch over other tables and listened hard to acquaintances' reports of their experiences. I am convinced that everyone at Per Se is pampered."
,"The service departs compellingly from the traditional French model by mingling formal attentiveness with breezy, even cheeky banter. I laughed one night as a server poured a slowly hardening chocolate shell over orange-scented vanilla ice cream; he alluded to an earlier dish that no one at my table had loved enough to finish."
,"\"Maybe,\" he said, \"we should have done this to the rabbit.\""
,"The dessert was listed on the menu as a \"creamsicle,\" an example of the way in which Per Se tries, with its food as well as its service, to inject a bit of wit into the proceedings. Mr. Keller's canap\u00E9 of salmon tartare - one of several carry-overs from the French Laundry - is served like a scoop of ice cream atop a black sesame cone that is filled with cr\u00E8me fra\u00EEche. No utensils required."
,"Mr. Keller divides his time between New York and Napa, often leaving Per Se in the hands of the chef de cuisine, Jonathan Benno, who was in charge on most of the nights I dined there. It is to him as well as Mr. Keller, then, that I owe prodigious thanks for a simultaneously comforting and thrilling dish of agnolotti filled with a sweet corn pudding. For a dizzyingly rich egg custard infused with white truffle oil. For tagliatelle with black truffles, which Per Se keeps frozen for use year-round. Sybaritic to the core, Per Se is big on truffles, and it is big on foie gras, which it prepares in many ways, depending on the night. I relished it most when it was poached sous vide, in a tightly sealed plastic pouch, with Sauternes and vanilla. The vanilla was a perfect accent, used in perfect proportion."
,"Per Se hunts down superior ingredients - turning to Elysian Fields Farm for lamb, Snake River Farms for Kobe beef - and lets them express themselves as clearly as possible. This is cooking as diligence and even perfectionism, not sleight of hand, and little fillips go a long way. That Kobe beef comes topped with a sliver of saut\u00E9ed marrow that deepens the richness of the meat tenfold."
,"But Per Se also dares to be different, and insists, sometimes to its slight detriment, on departing from favorites like grouper or Dover sole for something like cobia, a game fish that, at least at Per Se, was too chewy to warrant the trouble."
,"Per Se wants to dazzle and sometimes to challenge you. I recall in particular what I came to think of as a Wizard-of-Oz course of four different dishes of organ meats, including calf's brain (as delectably molten as foie gras) and calf's heart."
,"Those were part of an extended chef's tasting menu that Per Se presented to three friends and me as a special option, something it does for a few tables during every lunch and dinner. The usual options are a nine-course tasting menu for $150 and a five-course prix fixe for $125. Each of these proceeds from appetizer to seafood to meat and tacks on a reliably superior cheese course, with cheese being defined liberally enough to include, say, ravioli filled with it."
,"I recommend the nine courses, and I recommend that you let Per Se do wine pairings, which cost about $120 per person for a meal of that length. (Many bottles here cost more than that.) Per Se can be trusted with such decisions."
,"It lavishes attention on every aspect of a meal. The gin and tonic I had as an aperitif was an unusually smooth-tasting knockout that used tonic made in-house and came with a gorgeous, gleaming silver stirrer. The shallow pool of cr\u00E8me br\u00FBl\u00E9e that Per Se throws in, as an unheralded extra, among more elaborate desserts would be a lesser restaurant's claim to fame."
,"But this restaurant shoots straight for the stars. And it soars high - and often - enough to grab four of them."

"THERE are really only two problems with Prime Meats, the very good and very beautiful Germanish restaurant in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. The first is that the restaurant accepts no reservations, which can wreak havoc on the evening schedules of visitors who come from beyond walking distance to eat there."
,"You can see these people standing on Court Street nightly, staring through the plate-glass windows at a dining room packed with brownstone bohemians, third novelists, people with Web sites, with good art at home. They look slightly pained, these visitors from afar wondering about the life choices they made that put them in Chelsea or Park Slope or Montclair, and not down here in Carroll Gardens, this little Italian village off New York Harbor where life is obviously perfect."
,"Prime Meats is not a new restaurant, precisely. It opened slowly over the course of 2009, and only recently completed the addition of a large dining room off the original bar that makes the place feel, at last, like a proper restaurant and not just a cool anomaly, a bar with good food."
,"Streetlight reflects off Prime Meats\u2019 shiny black exterior. The aesthetics are magnetic: Dutch paint, rubbed wood, old mirrors, brick, warm light out of the past. The man on the door smiles down from his perch, takes names and cellphone numbers, tells people he\u2019ll call when their tables are ready. Maybe 90 minutes? A couple of hours?"
,"If only they lived on Clinton Street! They\u2019d be eating right now. People want in to this restaurant so bad!"
,"And with good reason. Serious pleasures await within: a salad of greens slicked in bacon vinaigrette, say, with matchsticks of apple and crunchy lardons of bacon, followed by roasted La Belle Rouge chicken, the breast brined in pickle juice before cooking and the bird\u2019s fat, luscious thigh meat shredded into a tangle with saut\u00E9ed farmstand greens."
,"It seems as simple a meal as you might find in a restaurant. But it is executed with a rare degree of excellence, from the salad with its silky nap of dressing and perfect, peppery greens to the complementary textures and deep flavors of the chicken."
,"The second problem with the restaurant is that it accepts no credit cards. This seems slightly ridiculous in 2010. An argument can be made, perhaps, for a restaurant not taking reservations, particularly for locals, who come to Prime Meats early and late, but rarely at peak hours. They use the restaurant for breakfast (oatmeal! French toast!) or for a terrific house-smoked pastrami sandwich at lunch. Learn the rhythms and you can avoid the crowds."
,"Cash only, though? At a restaurant where a dinner for four might run a considerate host more than $400?"
,"Have a Manhattan made by one of the whiz kids back behind the bar, some mustachioed chemist with tattoos and an understanding of bitters that rivals a rabbi\u2019s knowledge of the Talmud, then some brilliant oysters, fresh and clean and cold, tasting only a few hours out of the waters of Cape Cod or the Gulf of Maine."
,"Eat some roasted bone marrow with crunchy radishes, vibrant gremolata, caramel-like roasted garlic and toast; some malt-rich pretzels and fiery mustard; a spicy hunter\u2019s sausage; a few scoops of snoutish p\u00E2t\u00E9 or thin-sliced smoked pork belly. Devour a steak or an excellent burger along with some salty, crisp fries the color of burnished copper. Drink some gr&#252;ner with it all, or a few tankards of Sixpoint ale."
,"But forget to line your pockets in the manner of a Biggie Smalls impersonator and you\u2019re going to need to leave your guests before the end of it all, and walk to a bodega A.T.M. to rustle up enough cash to pay your bill. This is a grim feeling for a grown person to experience, right up there with walking around all day with a large knot of $20 bills in your pocket only because you\u2019re going to dinner someplace that doesn\u2019t take credit cards."
,"Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli, who own and run Prime Meats along with the fantastic Frankies Spuntino up the street and another Frankies in Manhattan, are two smart fellows. They are in the highest tier of Kings County restaurateurs. It is time for them to deal with the presumably horrible paperwork that accepting credit entails, to eat the service charges the companies extract, and to join the modern age of convenience."
,"There are really no other downsides to eating at their newest restaurant. The staff is exceptionally well trained and efficient, a crew of handsome men and women dressed as if ready to ride horses back home to Bushwick, where they trap beaver and make their own candles. And a meal in the restaurant proceeds with all the jollity and good manners of something scripted by Laura Ingalls Wilder and scored by the Grateful Dead. It is an extremely pleasant place."
,"What to eat: a thickly torn, apple-wood smoked trout salad to start, served over a folded crepe made out of spelt, textured and rich, with pickled red onion, a buttermilk dressing thickened with quark and a mess of fresh greens. The Vesper Brett, a snack board of German cured meats with pickles, mustard and bread - it\u2019s even better with pretzels. Saut\u00E9ed mushrooms with a fresh egg softly turned into it as if it were dressing on a salad. Some phenomenal split-pea soup if the weather is even remotely cool, with smoked ham."
,"Also: soft weisswurst like a hot dog from a parallel and slightly more enjoyable universe. Crisp saut\u00E9ed brook trout with fresh-shaved horseradish. A special of soft, sweet cod and firm, sweet spring peas. Sauerbraten in fragrant red cabbage, with pretzel dumplings. A massive c\u00F4te de boeuf, for two people, served with a deep sear, bright red interior and awesome mineral tang. Spaetzle with Gruy\u00E8re and ham. And another dish of it, with wild mushrooms and herbs."
,"Dessert is an afterthought, really: decent cr\u00E8me br&#251;l\u00E9e; a warm chocolate cake; soft apple tart. But cheese is not. There is a nice selection of Northeastern cow, sheep and goat cheeses worth lingering over with a final glass of wine, before the application of an excellent cup of Stumptown coffee and the surrender of your table. Walk out into the soft Brooklyn night as the Jayhawks play over the speakers in the bar."

"ROMY DOROTAN, the chef and an owner of Purple Yam, stood at the bar of his restaurant, looking out at Cortelyou Road in the rain. It was just after Christmas, and there were still holiday songs playing on the stereo behind him. It was early afternoon and the place smelled of fresh flowers, vinegar and fried pork. He looked a bit like a ship\u2019s captain: formidable, intimidating, kind."
,"There was a long brick wall behind him reminiscent of the one that dominated his last restaurant, Cendrillon, in SoHo, for more than a decade. Mr. Dorotan and his wife, Amy Besa, closed it in March. They moved to Brooklyn, to Ditmas Park, a neighborhood of Victorian houses and discount stores, to start again."
,"There was a family eating lunch at one of the booths in the back of the restaurant, across from its partly open kitchen, under a bead-board ceiling."
,"Purple Yam serves lunch on weekends only. It makes the most of the opportunity. There was a spread on the table: eggs, garlic-fried rice and tocino, the sweetened cured pork known sometimes as Filipino bacon; thin rice noodles with chicken, pork and swirls of vegetable; Balinese fried chicken and a pur\u00E9e of taro and sweet potato as rich as softened butter. The kids were drinking mango juice. The adults were drinking chai lattes."
,"Mr. Dorotan turned and regarded these people as an artist might a sketch. He went into the kitchen. A few moments later, he emerged with a small bowl of sambal, a kind of Malaysian ketchup, that he had cooked thick with coconut milk, brightened with lime. \"This is for the chicken,\" he said, and returned to his post by the window."
,"The chicken had been served with two dipping sauces already: one sour and soylike, the other with the peppery kick of a traditional American hot sauce. These were excellent. The sambal number, however, provoked happy gibberish from those who ate it over the chicken, who spooned it into their mouths like fiery yogurt."
,"Mr. Dorotan remained expressionless. He trimmed a few poinsettias at the bar, then returned to the kitchen. The dinner rush would be coming in less than six hours. He had work to do."
,"Purple Yam is not precisely Filipino. Mr. Dorotan\u2019s vision is too wide for such easy characterization. At Cendrillon, he used the Philippines as a point of reference for his cooking - Malay by nature, Chinese and Hispanic by curious nurture - and added European flavors to it. At Purple Yam, the menu has those old favorites but also looks widely across Asia for inspiration, most notably toward Korea, the cuisine of which provides both kimchi and flavored sojus, a mean bibimbap and a spicy tofu soup."
,"As at Cendrillon, the result is more than the sum of its parts. Purple Yam is a perfect neighborhood restaurant."
,"True to its aesthetic, the menu is resistant to easy division into appetizers and main courses. There are kimchis and chutneys to order. There are vegetables and side dishes. There is pig - almost every part of it. And there are Cendrillon classics, ranging from a sublime chicken adobo to a faintly ridiculous wild-boar pizza."
,"Ms. Besa can be found most evenings at the restaurant\u2019s door, in front of the crowded dining room, making small talk with her guests and, when necessary, apologizing for the long waits for a table or for food. There are date-night renters at the bar, kids from Ocean Avenue flats sharing an entree and a beer; local home-owning families eating out with neighbors; Filipinos who\u2019ve driven in from other parts of bedroom Brooklyn; a few bewildered travelers off the Q train."
,"The menu is studded with the sort of offerings that inspire craving. (Cravings are a key component to a successful neighborhood restaurant.)"
,"There is that chicken adobo, for instance. Adobo is a national dish of the Philippines, with probably as many recipes for it as there are islands in the archipelago. Some are soupy braises of chicken or pork in soy sauce and vinegar. Others are cooked down until almost dry."
,"This is Purple Yam\u2019s version: the chicken braised in rice vinegar, soy sauce, garlic and Thai chili pepper, and served in a vastly reduced pool of that liquid, now cut through and softened with coconut milk. Eat it with a bowl of fried rice anointed with bagoong, a kind of fermented shrimp paste, and it\u2019s possible to imagine it on the level of a neighborhood staple, up there with pizza or rotisserie chicken."
,"Other necessities include those glassy rice noodles with chicken and pork, a plate of oxtails stewed in tomatoes and peanuts and another of deep-fried pork belly with pickled papaya. There ought to be sisig on your table as well, the restaurant\u2019s fantastic, crisp meat salad: chopped pig snout, ears and jowls, crisp and fatty at once, in a slightly fiery lime dressing. (Go on: try it.)"
,"You\u2019ll want some kimchi. Maybe a salad of jicama and green papaya, too. In a depressing nod to market trends, there are \"sliders\" on the menu, Korean-style meatballs in small buns flavored with purple yams. (These aren\u2019t necessary. Nor are the restaurant\u2019s Chinese-style ribs.) There is slow-cooked duck leg, almost a confit, wrapped in banana leaves."
,"And there are marvelous desserts: rice pudding flavored with coffee and chocolate; flan rich with the nutty flavor of pandan. Best of all, there is halo halo, the Philippines\u2019 answer to an ice cream sundae: a parfait glass of sweet beans, palm seeds, all manner of coconut products and jackfruit, topped with flan and purple yam ice cream. The combination is hilarious, like an umbrella drink gone mad, and extremely delicious."
,"Years ago, well before Cendrillon, Mr. Dorotan lived in Key West. There is something of that place in his restaurant, even now."
,"Key West is where the American experiment sees its glorious proof: the poor living amid the wealthy; the gay amid the straight; the eccentric amid the strait-laced. Democrats eat side by side with Republicans in the Conch Republic, Latinos by whites by blacks by Asians. All humans swoon in the presence of a glorious sunset. (And a lot of alcohol.)"
,"At Purple Yam, a similar effect is achieved with adobo and halo halo. That is something worth experiencing, even if you\u2019re not moving in down the block."

"A GRAND parade streams along the West Village sidewalks, corner of 12th and Greenwich Streets, crossroads of a particular world. There are dog-walking fl\u00E2neurs; Westbeth pensioners; the young and desperate en route to the meat markets of the meatpacking district a few blocks north. Here are cabs stopping to let out real housewives. There are young professionals walking home to small apartments filled with books."
,"There is a restaurant, too, Recette. Jesse Schenker opened it a few months ago in the space that used to be Jarnac. It is small and crowded behind its windows, loud in the way that little Village restaurants can become loud, the sort of place men go wearing blazers, then pull them off halfway through the meal, where women flush and everyone leans into the table to talk."
,"Mr. Schenker is 27, bearded, wildly tattooed, with time spent in Gordon Ramsay\u2019s kitchen. For a while last year he ran Recette out of a Harlem bakery as a kind of private supper club, along with Christina Lee, his pastry chef. (Ms. Lee has bona fides of her own; she cooked at Per Se.) Now they\u2019ve come downtown to go big: American food with Spanish flavors, cooked with French technique; small plates, high concept."
,"The menu has a note at its top explaining that it was \"designed for you to construct your meal in accordance to your appetite - from one plate to a venturesome tasting.\" This reads like something you might hear some poor sap say on television, serving six courses of three-bite plates to a judicial panel of restaurant hacks and dour comedians. Small plates, if you\u2019re not drinking sherry in Barcelona, rarely satisfy. What once were tapas are now things served on the Food Network."
,"As in Chelsea galleries, though, perhaps so too in West Village kitchens: The artists who make the work are rarely the people who ought to explain it. The cooking at Recette is smart and imaginative, the food that results from it elegant and full of flavor. (The plates aren\u2019t even that small.)"
,"The wine list is deep and the service friendly and able, if sometimes overwhelmed. You may have to ask for water a couple of times. There will be the occasional crash of a dropped wineglass. It is casual, almost to a fault. But Recette is a very good restaurant."
,"Snacks, in the restaurant\u2019s parlance, should start your meal. Order them the moment you sit, along with a glass of the restaurant\u2019s excellent gr&#252;ner veltliner, a 2003 Hirsch that has some character to it. You\u2019ll want a platter of the restaurant\u2019s cured and potted meats as well, along with some codfish fritters and a serving of cannellini beans with chorizo and white anchovy."
,"The charcuterie plate offers slices of the small and peppery salami known as cacciatore and some melting sheets of Bayonne ham (air-dried in France, not New Jersey). These are unimpeachable. But Mr. Schenker\u2019s foie gras terrine is revelatory, a single slice revealing a kind of glistening mosaic, perfect in its form, each lobe of the liver unmolested by the process: luscious, creamy, with a faint mineral tang. It\u2019s a meat painting, an organ sculpture; like most complicated French cooking, it tastes utterly complete, perfect in the way a ripe strawberry is, or a fresh-shucked oyster."
,"In that, the terrine plays ing\u00E9nue to Mr. Schenker\u2019s t&#234;te de cochon, also on the plate, a rough-hewn and big-flavored head cheese. There is some grainy mustard with it, a few sweetly pickled vegetables. These act as rings and scarves and kohl do for Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp. They elevate toughness to beauty."
,"The codfish fritters come beneath a drizzle of curried aioli, bright and lemony, and above a few tablespoons of fiery lamb-sausage rag\u00F9. This is a head-scratchingly good combination. You may wish for a double order, though the fish \u2019n\u2019 meat combination is revisited with those soft white cannellini beans in their porky chorizo sauce, beneath anchovy hats. Brightness and fire combine again in the presence of acidity. Some more of that gr&#252;ner would be nice with this."
,"There aren\u2019t really appetizers beyond the snacks, or main dishes. There is a short list of plates of various sizes, all ambitious in design and execution; the menu is remarkably free of stuff that\u2019s available everywhere else."
,"On the smaller, lighter end, a spring evening might suggest a salad of peppery wild arugula, with kumquats, mint, lemon, hazelnuts and a few shavings of ricotta salata for salt and creaminess. There is also an excellent little cigar of duck carpaccio wrapped around chicken liver mousse, accompanied by crisp apple and fragrant thyme."
,"Pork belly, cooked with a sherry-laced caramel, with rock shrimp and roasted baby turnips, arrives alongside a spat of almondy, piquillo-fired romesco sauce. It\u2019s terrific: Spain on a plate, as seen from Manhattan. And even the offal-phobic may be converted by a sweetbread fried crisp and to a melting interior, served with brown butter sauce studded with capers and dressed with lemon and parsley, aside some wilted escarole. It hits the flavor stations hard: salty and sweet, with an acidic bite at the end."
,"Mr. Schenker\u2019s ocean trout is sweetly nutty beneath its crisp skin, with an earthy dressing of smoked bacon and savoy cabbage, bluefoot mushrooms and a foam of emulsified shellfish broth that\u2019s dated enough to be cheeky. It tastes of high tide and the sun. Pair it with a golden baby chicken served with soft grits and a rough mustard soubise. This makes for hearty eating and a strong case for more grits in your life besides."
,"(Those obsessed with portion size will either rush toward or avoid entirely a single roasted scallop served with a smidgen of braised oxtail, earthy morels and a green-garlic pur\u00E9e, as in the Pacific Northwest. It\u2019s phenomenally good, but you could eat it in perhaps two bites.)"
,"Ms. Lee, meanwhile, waits in the wings with her showstoppers. A roasted apple napoleon is one, served with caramel ice cream and a nearly savory Earl Grey milk jam. A deconstructed s\u2019more that looks like an Elizabeth Peyton canvas is another, with graham-cracker ice cream, toasted marshmallow cream and a knife-cut of cayenne-hyped milk-chocolate ganache."
,"This is what Girl Scouts taste camping, and what they spend the rest of their lives looking for at the end of meals. Ms. Lee and Mr. Schenker are going to be around for a while."

"IF you're the kind of well-fed, restaurant-knowledgeable New Yorker who doles out recommendations about where to eat, there are three syllables that regularly escape your lips, a ready answer for what acquaintances want when they know vaguely, but not precisely, what they want."
,"A place with sophisticated food but not a whiff of arrogance about it? The Red Cat. A place that looks good but not too good, that simmers attractively without sizzling flamboyantly? The Red Cat."
,"Somewhere you can treat a business associate or a family member to a dinner that feels sufficiently special and not bust the bank? The Red Cat. Somewhere you can take someone who might be a date (but, then again, might not) and leave your designs ambiguous, your options open. Hint: a domesticated animal in a popular color for fast cars."
,"By turns cozy and sexy, laid-back and fleet, the Red Cat is a restaurant Rorschach, different things at different times to different people, which is just what its owners, Jimmy Bradley and Danny Abrams, intended. The simultaneously prosaic and cryptic name they gave it alludes to nothing, connotes nothing. It's a phrase to be imbued with whatever meaning the imbuing party deems fit."
,"Mr. Bradley and Mr. Abrams did not want to be pigeonholed into any one tidy theme or identity, so they jumbled the decorative motifs, hanging Moroccan lanterns from the ceilings, putting framed paintings and photographs on the walls and using reclaimed barn wood from Pennsylvania, some of it painted red and some white, as paneling. The Red Cat feels vaguely colonial and tavernlike, except when it feels downtown-gallery cool, and apart from those moments when it feels modestly and eclectically elegant. Choose your mood."
,"The menu is more coherent, more of a piece. It doesn't take ethnic sides. But it fairly consistently mines a middle ground between Continental and new American, timeless Mediterranean and of-the-moment Manhattan, where unabashedly hearty preparations and ingredients meet seasonal produce and whimsical flourishes, where comfort and classicism welcome innovation without letting it run roughshod."
,"It's an immensely appealing place, recently inhabited by a loin of rabbit wrapped in pancetta and surrounded by fava beans, cipollini onions and dates. On many menus this dish would be an entree, but Mr. Bradley, the restaurant's chef, does it as an appetizer. In a similar vein he includes among the starters a baby lamb chop Milanese, which is encrusted with mustard and panko and skirted with baked tomatoes, olives and capers."
,"Mr. Bradley loves Italy, and so there is also a simple, excellent appetizer of saut\u00E9ed zucchini slivers with pecorino cheese and toasted almonds. But his heart is roomy enough to open the door to potato pierogi saut\u00E9ed in plenty of butter and paired with hon shimeji mushrooms and chunks of poached lobster."
,"He bends to accommodate trends and has lately been serving a seared tuna appetizer, albeit one with real personality, thanks to currents of curry and a chili pepper vinaigrette. He accommodates lighter appetites with a delightful salad with chevrot cheese, pear and pumpkin seeds."
,"The menu changes frequently, so some of those dishes will soon be retired or significantly tweaked. But you can count on encountering the zucchini saut\u00E9, a Red Cat staple, along with green beans tempura, an addictive side dish with a dipping sauce of extra-zingy honey mustard - honey mustard on steroids."
,"You can count on a terrific pork tenderloin among the entrees. It is bathed before cooking in a sugar marinade, and served with morels. You can count on an expertly grilled shell steak. You can count on the rest of the entrees running a predictable but sensible gamut: chicken and duck; salmon or Arctic char; cod or black bass or such."
,"You can count on plates that are composed generously, with a bounty of vegetables and sometimes a whole extra dimension, like the richly satisfying vegetable risotto on which Mr. Bradley placed cod. And you can pretty much count on careful cooking. A skate wing was ideally crispy on the outside without being remotely dry on the inside."
,"The Red Cat opened in 1999, when it received one star in The New York Times from William Grimes. Its location, on a fringe of Chelsea, among a growing gallery scene, seemed much more remote then than now, but the Red Cat has never relied solely on its neighborhood for business. Its fluid, flexible nature is such that it seems - and is - in equal measures a local joint and a destination. It's the exceedingly rare place that can often take a reservation only a few days in advance and yet is almost always packed."
,"Some of the locals eat at the bar - and began doing so here long before that practice became a citywide fashion. The Red Cat was also ahead of the curve in grouping the wines on its list not by country but by character: \"Floral Whites,\" \"Sangiovese, Nebbiolo and Earthy Reds.\""
,"It has been a prolific sire: first of the Harrison, which has a slightly stiffer posture; then of the Mermaid Inn, which frolics casually in the surf; and most recently of Pace, which went full-on Italian and stumbled a bit. None have quite the Red Cat's easy confidence or irresistible spirit. Mr. Bradley even roasts and serves suckling pig here every Sunday. That's a Red Cat kind of thing to do."
,"Dishes at the Red Cat do not rise to sublime heights; that's not a Red Cat thing. Not all the desserts are as terrific as a rocky road sundae and an orange panna cotta, and a cookie sampler is entirely forgettable. The intensely friendly service can turn spacey, as when no one remembered to put a requested candle in the dessert of a friend who was celebrating a birthday."
,"But I always leave the Red Cat happy. It doesn't have the best this or the best that. It isn't a star pitcher or a marquee shortstop. It's an expert utility player, and maybe that's what red cat means - or should mean from now on."

"IT is hard to know what to make of Tamarind Tribeca at first, seeing it rise up from the corner of Hudson and Franklin Streets, sleek and glass-fronted, like a bank."
,"The restaurant is gigantic, occupying more than 10,000 square feet in the space where a sticky little coffee shop called Socrates and a grim sports bar used to be. (Nobu is across the street.) There are towering windows and acres of warm Brazilian teak, a run of marble at the bar, stairs up to a mezzanine. Roughly 500 staff members seem to be milling about in the mango-hued light."
,"It hardly seems intimate. The foyer has enough room for a few dozen people. You can feel a little lost. Families are scarce in the dining room - dates, friendships, too. Pressed shirts abound, and wide English ties. Suit jackets are thrown over the backs of chairs and bar stools. The restaurant seems almost ostentatious, with its excess of design and wide passageways: as if it might be a pan-Indian food mill for the professional class, of little use or interest to those who chase the delicious."
,"The city has another Tamarind up in the Flatiron district, a decade-old exercise in sophisticated Indian cuisine, and when this TriBeCa version opened in April, it appeared simply to be a newer model of the first one, brought downtown to capitalize on the neighborhood\u2019s wealth and proximity to the financial markets."
,"But then! Here is a booth in which to sit, quiet and slightly removed from the bustle of the rest of the room, separated from others by a sheer curtain; or a little table in the restaurant\u2019s back, like a small square off a town\u2019s main one; or one of the tables upstairs on the mezzanine that looks over the dining room as if at a city."
,"It comes as a surprise: Tamarind is an extremely pleasant place to dine, and despite the size of the room, it is possible for a group to have a conversation there as if in a private home."
,"Here, too, is Gary Walia, the restaurant\u2019s manager (nephew to Avtar Walia, the owner), directing his well-trained and helpful staff as if he were conducting an orchestra, greeting guests in the manner of a subcontinental Julian Niccolini, of the Four Seasons restaurant in Midtown. He treats strangers as regulars, and regulars with glee."
,"The bar serves an excellent gin and tonic, cold and tall. And the restaurant has an extensive wine list, well suited to the cuisine, if a little vast and expensive at the high end. So, have a drink and consider some curry-laced crab cakes and crisp pomegranate samosas, and the promise beyond them of a menu that can take diners across India in the name of flavor, and represent that nation\u2019s varied cuisine with pride and great skill."
,"In London, where marvelous Indian food is as much a part of the culinary landscape as French restaurants or steakhouses are here, Tamarind Tribeca might rate a pleasant shrug. But in Manhattan, it is shaping up to be the best thing to happen to Indian food since Hemant Mathur and Suvir Saran opened Devi in 2004."
,"The menu is more extensive than at Tamarind\u2019s Flatiron branch. Under the direction of Peter Beck, the restaurant\u2019s executive chef, it sprawls: cooking from Punjab, Goa, Hyderabad, Madras, Calcutta and Lucknow are all represented."
,"And its desserts are ambitious, Westernized, recalling in sweets what the chef Floyd Cardoz has done at Tabla with savory Indian food, with a list that offers both a goat cheese cr\u00E8me br&#251;l\u00E9e and a brilliant coconut mousse \"bombe\" with a chocolate-Darjeeling ganache and pineapple butter cake."
,"By all means save room for those. But begin your meal with an appetizer called bataki kosha, which offers a kind of rice-crepe egg roll of shredded duck scented with garam masala, mustard and onion, ginger and garlic, then deep-fried and served with tangerine chutney. Another, galouti kebab, traditionally made with mutton, brings small patties of lamb scented with dozens of spices - coriander, cumin, cardamom and cloves are definitely four of them - that call out for Kingfisher beer and perhaps a second order."
,"Nizami keema is a marvel: an appetizing sandwich of grilled and minced lamb, pungent with cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and a high pitch of lemon zest, in a small bun. As are turmeric-hued saut\u00E9ed scallops, with poppy seeds and a bright lemon sauce."
,"It is hardly soup weather. But Tamarind offers two worth tasting all the same, buttery and rich: a regal lobster with carrots and garlic, Cognac and cayenne pepper; and a silky butternut squash with fenugreek seeds, lemon grass and a low roar of green chilies."
,"The entrees are as ambitious, though a simple, luscious, heat-infused chicken tikka masala proves a fine explanation of why this totally inauthentic dish might displace roast beef in the hearts of the British. Offset by a pile of goat-meat biriyani, funky and rich, some excellent stewed garbanzo beans with pomegranate powder, ginger and tomatoes, and some of the cheese-infused spinach known as saag paneer, it made for a memorable meal."
,"So did lamb shank braised in Indian rum, with a soft, addictive sauce of onions, cashews, saffron and nutmeg, a perfect topping for the restaurant\u2019s pillowy basmati rice, and a good partner to a glossy bowl of dal makhani as well, lentils simmered with garlic, ginger and a great deal of clarified butter."
,"Dry, chalky pan-seared halibut was disappointing, and a flavorful roasted lobster managed to appear on the plate as if it had been prepared in a wood-chipper. But sea bass cooked in the tandoor oven was breathtakingly well prepared, the intense heat of the oven somehow sealing in the flavor of the fish, and a dressing of thick yogurt, dill, lime zest and peppercorns enhancing it."
,"Venison chops also benefited from the tandoor treatment, marinated in pickling spices, then coated in chickpea flour and yogurt before cooking. You might put these up against roasted lamb chops for a taste test, marinated in yogurt, cardamom, garlic, black cumin seeds and nutmeg. It\u2019s a fair fight."
,"Winner takes on the prawns: just charred by the oven, big and meaty, spiced to blaze mouths and bring laughter. Everyone wins."

"SATURDAY night in the neighborhood that once gave America fever, a Brooklyn that looks to itself for employment and has little time for the glittering island to the north. A bridge rises out of it, a silver ramp, and you can see ocean beneath it, darkness running all the way to Portugal, and from there down the Mediterranean to the Middle East. Dinner time."
,"Couples slide into tables at Tanoreen, Rawia Bishara\u2019s marbled Levantine restaurant on the corner of Third Avenue and 76th Street in Bay Ridge, lately expanded from its tiny birth site in a storefront one block south. They join families with children, friends meeting friends. It is a lively, happy scene set beneath clouds of lamb, mint and garlic scents combined."
,"Arabic music plays over speakers connected to a stereo set in back, and if this time it\u2019s not the Lebanese siren Fairuz, singing \"Al Bosta,\" which evokes a village called Tanoreen, it might as well be."
,"Fairuz is known in the Middle East as \"the neighbor to the moon.\" Much the same could be said of Ms. Bishara, a Palestinian who grew up in Nazareth, in northern Israel, and who has been in the United States for close to four decades. She owns Tanoreen with her daughter, Jumana, whose eyes sparkle in the same almond shape as her mother\u2019s."
,"These women rule over the kitchen and dining room with a kind of fierce benevolence. But it is the boundless cooking and endless, prodding hospitality of Ms. Bishara the elder that have defined the restaurant. At Tanoreen, she is celestial."
,"Pickles come to the table first: delicate, sweet beets tangy with vinegar, lovely against a glass of mint tea. Palates jump to attention. They are greeted then by plates and plates of appetizers, or mezze. Sujok, an air-dried Armenian beef sausage scented with cumin and sumac, arrives in a small pool of spicy olive oil, bright with garlic. Eat a slice with a piece of the restaurant\u2019s thin pita or crunchy zatar-spiced bread, then take another bite of beet."
,"Follow this with a bit of ethereal hummus, lightened with lemon juice to the point of being cloudlike, and some crazily flavorful tabbouleh, whose mint and bulgur combine into something that tastes very much like joy."
,"There is baba ghanouj as well, smoky and rich in its eggplant base, and fattoush, a marvelous salad made of lettuce and cucumber, tomatoes and mint, sumac and parsley. It is dressed in olive oil, lemon and garlic, and layered in toasted wedges of pita, which Ms. Bishara uses throughout her cooking for texture, to great effect."
,"Here now are some florets of cauliflower, browned to softness then allowed to cool, dressed in tahini and lines of pomegranate molasses, astringent sweetness against the flavors of sesame and vegetable. And a napoleon of eggplant, fried soft and sweet, then layered with baba ghanouj and festooned with tomatoes and - what\u2019s this? - basil."
,"Ms. Bishara\u2019s translation of Middle Eastern cooking has Mediterranean accents, and occasional North American ones from her decades in the United States. And so the tang of cilantro enlivens some of her dishes, and the musk of basil, the welcome zing of jalape\u00F1o."
,"In the opposite direction, she makes a simple spiced roast chicken with potatoes (and, for children, a mean plate of fried chicken fingers with French fries and ketchup), and a stuffed cabbage that your Uncle Murray who only eats tuna salad would devour."
,"Tanoreen\u2019s entrees are, in the main, less successful than the appetizers. Partly this is because the food doesn\u2019t support the division of a meal into the Western tradition of starter and main course. After four or five delicious small plates, it\u2019s difficult to do battle with a gristly lamb shank or one-acre lot of shepherd\u2019s pie."
,"It is smarter, perhaps, to order more from the appetizer lists - some small spinach or meat pies, for instance, and a plate of kibbe, the fried nuggets of ground lamb and spices that are meat\u2019s answer to M&M\u2019s, followed by some ridiculously flavorful stuffed grape leaves. Then share sparingly of the main courses, along with some simply saut\u00E9ed spinach or kale."
,"The best of the entrees include lamb fette, traditionally a breakfast dish, here layered with toasted pita and yogurt, chickpeas and mountains of meat flavored with Ms. Bishara\u2019s secret blend of Tanoreen spices (cinnamon, coriander, cumin, some nutmeg, dried ginger, rosebuds and pixie dust), with pilaf cut through with vermicelli. It would serve a platoon of Marines."
,"There is also a terrific combination platter of grilled lamb and chicken, and another of delicate fried red snapper, and saut\u00E9ed shrimp that is as redolent of garlic as that at any Italian ristorante on Sheepshead Bay. The kibbe entree is also worth a look - fried crisp on its exterior, with pillowy lamb within. The falafel sandwich is superb."
,"Service is professional if slightly scattershot - Ms. Bishara\u2019s staff is still coming to terms, perhaps, with the larger room, which has 50 more seats than the old one, and a full bar besides. There are occasionally long delays between courses (another argument for investing heavily in small plates). You might need to ask for water a few times."
,"But whenever spirits flag, it seems, Ms. Bishara appears at an elbow, eyes flashing and smile wide, to check in or apologize, to inquire after health and happiness, to see what might be done to improve the meal. This does a lot, as it happens, to mitigate a restaurant\u2019s shortcomings. It is part of Tanoreen\u2019s ethos."
,"So, too, is dessert. Knafeh, or shredded phyllo dough stuffed with sweet cheese and topped with pistachios and rosewater syrup, is the signature dessert. But sahlab, a sweet custard that nods to France\u2019s occupation of Lebanon between the world wars, is worth a spoon as well, as is a plate of baklava, sticky with honey and rich with nuts."
,"Tanoreen is, at the end, a deeply individualistic restaurant. Ms. Bishara is a Brooklynite, though also a Palestinian raised in Israel, where her brother served in the Knesset. Her restaurant has a Lebanese name. She sprinkles basil over her lamb."
,"Is such cooking authentic? Yes, though no. It doesn\u2019t matter and who cares. It\u2019s mostly delicious. Authenticity, anyway, is almost always a lie."

"THERE is one piece of framed art at Torrisi Italian Specialties, a tiny and terrific new restaurant on Mulberry Street at the very top of Little Italy. It is a large photograph of Billy Joel, a reproduction of a promotional still released with his album \"The Stranger,\" in 1977."
,"Mr. Joel wears a wide-shouldered suit of the age, with a loose tie and a pair of boxing gloves knotted around his shoulders. He is 28. He looks wistful, not unhappy, grown."
,"The image - propped on a shelf above an installation of plastic Italian-ice containers, set between shelved cans of peeled tomatoes and bottles of Manhattan Special espresso soda - serves as introduction to the loving, ironical heart of a restaurant that is unlike any other in Manhattan."
,"During the day, Torrisi is a sandwich shop modeled on those of the neighborhood old school. You can get a good chicken parm or an excellent turkey hero there, some flavorful contorni, a can of beer, a small bottle of Coke. The dishes are all smart upgrades on classics, beautifully cooked, humble Italian-American lunch fare for an era that respects the form."
,"At night, though, the room is transformed into a restaurant of around 20 seats, in which artists make work and customers consume it. The prix fixe for this is $50. The food is still beautifully cooked, still aggressively Italian-American: the dried pastas and Progresso bread crumbs and other Little Italy grocery items stacked on shelves are not for show."
,"But the dishes are no longer humble. They are edible paintings, comestible short stories. It is strange and wonderful to eat them in the same place you were sitting before, eating a chicken parm."
,"The restaurant\u2019s menu, written and executed by the owners and chefs, Mario Carbone and Rich Torrisi, changes every day. It offers eight courses set over the classic Italian rhythm: antipasti into pasta, into protein, into dessert. Over the course of a number of meals, over a number of months, the restaurant shows itself to be towering in its ambition. Say what you like, Billy Joel could play the piano."
,"There is always warm, just-made mozzarella as a starter, sprinkled with salt and drizzled with olive oil, and rich garlic toast on which to place it: outrageously good beneath its garnish of dried tomato, its weight of olive oil."
,"There is always a little Italian ice to end the meal - tart grapefruit recently - and then a plate of classic Italian cookies and mini cannolis of the sort you can still get on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx or along Court Street in Brooklyn, only approximately 22 times better in quality here."
,"But the rest, save for the decision to have meat or fish for the entree, is dealers\u2019 choice. A server will tell you so at the start of the meal, when she asks for your drink order: beer or wine only, off a concise all-American list, on top of housemade sparkling water or city-run tap."
,"(And no joke intended: perhaps a bottle of ros\u00E9? The W&#246;lffer, from Long Island, works well in this weather.) The dance begins then, casual and rowdy, and you in the middle of it."
,"Corned tongue with cucumber and pickled garlic was one evening\u2019s starter, along with salami toast spread thick with baccal\u00E0 and cured lemon. Once there was a beach-foraged salad of sea beans and butter lettuce, cactus leaves and sea rocket, followed by pickled eggplant with fiery lamb sausage and a smoked-sable crostini with cod roe, cr\u00E8me fra&#238;che and everything-bagel spices."
,"Another night, sweetbread Milanese made the scene: a gem on the plate, salty and rich, beside a soft dish of potatoes and egg scrambled with herbs, beside yet another of fresh ham with mustard and a hunk of Cheddar. A cucumber salad took us through to the pasta that evening, dressed in a dried scallop vinaigrette that seemed to come from a fantasy Italy, better even than the real one, farther south on Mulberry Street, closer to Chinatown."
,"The pasta course stays on the American end of the Italian-American spectrum. (All the ingredients at Torrisi are American grown or made.) You might get clams and spaghetti with a Tabasco sauce, brine and fire combined along the length of the noodles, or a soft sheep\u2019s-milk ricotta gnocchi, gnudi-like in texture, with lemony asparagus."
,"One night brought fusilli in an offal-rich duck rag\u00F9; another, a sweet ravioli with a tang of red wine vinegar and a low hum of salty chicken liver. The menu had it named for Caruso, the opera singer. You could have tasted it over the radio and wept."
,"The entrees are deceptively simple. The fish option might be skate Francese, buttery against the crisp skin of the fat wing, with a rushing undercurrent of lemon to match a throw of sweet sugar-snaps, a master class in fish-station technique. One evening there was tilefish carrying a load of blue-crab backfin meat, with small fried artichokes to amplify the richness of the meat."
,"Black bass came drenched in a Manhattan-style chowder broth on another night, with pilot crackers for texture and thickening. It tasted of the Fulton Street of Joseph Mitchell, up in his old hotel."
,"Meat options have included deviled chicken with a skin crisp enough almost to crackle, leavened by a swab of yogurt the texture of sour cream. And there was Long Island duck with broccoli rabe and a mulberry mustard - the fat beneath the skin rendered almost to the consistency of butter on its way to melting."
,"Most recently, there was a heritage pork chop, cooked crunchy and dark on the outside, soft and luscious within, beneath a tangle of vinegar-laced roast peppers. A roasted, glazed pork rib, fiery and bold, was placed on top as a garnish. Whatever the option, you\u2019ll be asking for your icey after, and will take it slow through the cookies."
,"The whole process takes roughly an hour, over bare wood tables, with paper napkins and wine out of water glasses. It is not fine dining, but it sure is fine."
,"No reservations are taken. The best strategy for a table is to go as a couple, either at 5:30 for the first service at 6, or on the hour thereafter, with the hope that you will be seated within 90 minutes. (Leave the number for your mobile phone and go get a cheap drink at the Spring Lounge, or an expensive one at Balthazar.) Larger groups should consult horoscopes and witch doctors for advice."
,"It sounds awful, the waiting. But Mr. Carbone and Mr. Torrisi are in a burst of creative excellence, and reinventing themselves daily. Theirs is not the simple, pared-down Italian-American food of the Frankies restaurants - their cooking is too aggressively technical for that. But it is simpler than the inventive, luxurious new-Italian fare of Michael White at Marea or Mark Ladner at Del Posto. It is reminiscent most of the spirit of Gabrielle Hamilton at Prune, and of the early days of David Chang at Momofuku Noodle Bar."
,"And how long can that last? The Torrisi project as it stands surely must run its course, the way any performance does, the way any combination of kinetic energy and art must eventually fall off its axis. (What happens if the money gets tight? No one counts on the tears.) Presumably Mr. Carbone and Mr. Torrisi will cook this way until it gets boring, and then will do something else."
,"Which means the time to get to Torrisi Italian Specialties is now."

"THIS is a city of beautiful restaurants. No one who has lunched at Le Bernardin, or wandered at twilight into the Harrison, or spent a Don Draper evening under the towering ceilings of Eleven Madison Park can deny it. These dining rooms are stages, for both chef and customer. They captivate."
,"Design matters in restaurants as much as food. Sometimes more. A great dining room can enhance a so-so meal, as at the late Chumley\u2019s or the current \"21\" Club, or it can serve as a minimalist frame for a brilliant one, as at Momofuku Ko or Sushi Yasuda."
,"Add modest young Vandaag to the rolls of the attractive: a comfortable restaurant of vaguely Dutch inflection that Brendan Spiro opened in the East Village in late July, in a space by Eric Mailaender of Resistance Design. It is large and airy, high ceilinged, uncrowded and clean. (Most recently the address was Bounce Deuce, a barbecue place that became a noxious, shouty sports bar.)"
,"Vandaag (the name is Dutch for \"today\") is the sort of dining room you could move into with a couple of tattered leather armchairs, and sit all day, bare feet on the polished concrete floor, reading novels."
,"Detective-Sergeant Rinus de Gier, the occasionally Buddhist Amsterdam policeman in the novels of Janwillem van de Wetering, would be right at home there."
,"Black banquettes and wooden chairs make up the seating, beneath simple wooden tables. Heavy Dansk silverware sits upon them, and sassy plates from the New English, a British design firm. These combine to offer a kind of casually luxe, Wallpaper-magazine feel to your meal. A few posters decorate the walls. Streetlight twinkles through the wide plate-glass window along Second Avenue, and through the smaller ones along East Sixth Street. A long zinc bar takes up part of the northern wall, neat as a gallery, with laboratory stools lined up before it. Vandaag is comfortable. Nothing is out of place."
,"The bar is an excellent place to start a meal that walks in step with this design, that is both simplicity and elegance combined. Katie Stipe, the restaurant\u2019s barkeep, has contributed to Vandaag a winning list of drinks, cocktails that make a strong case for themselves, rather than simply coasting on appletini fumes. Built of the ancient Dutch style of gin called genever - as well as of aquavit; beer from Holland, Belgium and Scandinavia; and wine from Germany and Austria - they combine in fascinating ways."
,"A simple gin cocktail, for instance, brings a glass of icy Bols genever, mixed with a reduction of golden ale, bitters, the faint taste and color of kirschwasser and a hint of absinthe. A Bohemian spritz offers a mix of gr&#252;ner veltliner and vermouth, a liqueur of elderflowers and another of pine cones, some sparkling wine and grapefruit zest. Both are delicious, refreshing and thought provoking: Who knew?"
,"And while improving on the martini ideal is impossible, Ms. Stipe\u2019s Turf War, which combines aquavit, Lillet, maraschino juice, orange bitters and absinthe, with both an olive and a twist of lemon, comes close. James Van Der Bond would approve."
,"Over at the tables, where a capable, handsome serving staff provides close and almost control-freaky service, the menu proves to be just as inventive, a version of Northern European cooking refracted through an East Village lens. The chef, Phillip Kirschen-Clark, is an alumnus of Corton and WD-50, the Pegu Club and Jimmy\u2019s No. 43. He did not come to Vandaag to serve pea soup and rye bread."
,"Instead there are fat, barely pickled Blue Point oysters that taste of the East Village\u2019s once-vibrant appetizing stores, and pickled sausages that come straight from the neighborhood\u2019s still-extant Ukrainian meat markets. Mr. Kirschen-Clark\u2019s salad of red Russian kale arrives mixed with nutty green strawberries, sweet onions and caraway - the combination unfamiliar and close to transcendent. (His sea-urchin bisque with little buds of basil and a drizzle of chili oil, served one night as an amuse-bouche, another night as a full-order special, went the distance.) Chilled cucumber soup comes tasting of ginger, mint and gin, with hints of pickled cantaloupe and smoked eel. Sounds awful? It is the opposite."
,"It is best to start with a plate of the house-cured pickles, those sausages and an oyster per person, and consume these with your drinks. (Bread? Vandaag charges $6 for a basket, with a side of juniper-scented gin butter and some lentil spread. That may make business sense. But it comes off as churlish.)"
,"Follow with those soups, if available, and some nuggets of fried lamb sweetbreads, with a vinaigrette flavored with Maggi, the Swiss version of soy sauce, now produced in China. A gravlax made with sockeye salmon is also worth ordering, with watercress and shallots, dots of salmon roe and plenty of dill. Bitterballen, a kind of Dutch bar snack that is essentially a fried meatball, is here built from slow-braised oxtail meat, and comes with a biting mustard relish."
,"There are missteps among the main courses. The lamb shoulder is fatty and the pork chop tough; the restaurant\u2019s \"ham\" burger, a mixture of pork and beef cooked as a roulade, sliced and seared, simply cannot hold up to the preparation."
,"But littleneck clams in a broth redolent of both aquavit and vanilla, with Aleppo peppers and a tangle of crisp parsnip fries, are excellent, and the hen for two, the breast roasted with lemon and bay laurel, and the leg confited, torn and served on toast, with fried potatoes and dandelion greens, is magnificent, the sort of bird to bring favor back to white meat."
,"The breast is moist and lemony-fragrant beneath its crisp skin, and combined with a side order of spicy-sweet hete bliksem, or \"hot lightning\" - crisp fingerling potatoes combined with smoky bacon, slivers of apple and a velvet blanket of stroop, a Dutch caramel syrup - it makes for the sort of meal you can wake up thinking about a few mornings in a row."
,"Mr. Kirschen-Clark provides Vandaag\u2019s desserts as well as its savory dishes. Many of these are less sweet than the hete bliksem, though no less welcome for that. A stroopwafel is probably best, though, with a cup of coffee, the thin waffle warming in the steam. Eating it in this room is to be thrilled by the unfamiliar, and to experience what the art critic Robert Hughes called the shock of the new. That\u2019s what good design is for, too."

"IF you're the kind of well-fed, restaurant-knowledgeable New Yorker who doles out recommendations about where to eat, there are three syllables that regularly escape your lips, a ready answer for what acquaintances want when they know vaguely, but not precisely, what they want."
,"A place with sophisticated food but not a whiff of arrogance about it? The Red Cat. A place that looks good but not too good, that simmers attractively without sizzling flamboyantly? The Red Cat."
,"Somewhere you can treat a business associate or a family member to a dinner that feels sufficiently special and not bust the bank? The Red Cat. Somewhere you can take someone who might be a date (but, then again, might not) and leave your designs ambiguous, your options open. Hint: a domesticated animal in a popular color for fast cars."
,"By turns cozy and sexy, laid-back and fleet, the Red Cat is a restaurant Rorschach, different things at different times to different people, which is just what its owners, Jimmy Bradley and Danny Abrams, intended. The simultaneously prosaic and cryptic name they gave it alludes to nothing, connotes nothing. It's a phrase to be imbued with whatever meaning the imbuing party deems fit."
,"Mr. Bradley and Mr. Abrams did not want to be pigeonholed into any one tidy theme or identity, so they jumbled the decorative motifs, hanging Moroccan lanterns from the ceilings, putting framed paintings and photographs on the walls and using reclaimed barn wood from Pennsylvania, some of it painted red and some white, as paneling. The Red Cat feels vaguely colonial and tavernlike, except when it feels downtown-gallery cool, and apart from those moments when it feels modestly and eclectically elegant. Choose your mood."
,"The menu is more coherent, more of a piece. It doesn't take ethnic sides. But it fairly consistently mines a middle ground between Continental and new American, timeless Mediterranean and of-the-moment Manhattan, where unabashedly hearty preparations and ingredients meet seasonal produce and whimsical flourishes, where comfort and classicism welcome innovation without letting it run roughshod."
,"It's an immensely appealing place, recently inhabited by a loin of rabbit wrapped in pancetta and surrounded by fava beans, cipollini onions and dates. On many menus this dish would be an entree, but Mr. Bradley, the restaurant's chef, does it as an appetizer. In a similar vein he includes among the starters a baby lamb chop Milanese, which is encrusted with mustard and panko and skirted with baked tomatoes, olives and capers."
,"Mr. Bradley loves Italy, and so there is also a simple, excellent appetizer of saut\u00E9ed zucchini slivers with pecorino cheese and toasted almonds. But his heart is roomy enough to open the door to potato pierogi saut\u00E9ed in plenty of butter and paired with hon shimeji mushrooms and chunks of poached lobster."
,"He bends to accommodate trends and has lately been serving a seared tuna appetizer, albeit one with real personality, thanks to currents of curry and a chili pepper vinaigrette. He accommodates lighter appetites with a delightful salad with chevrot cheese, pear and pumpkin seeds."
,"The menu changes frequently, so some of those dishes will soon be retired or significantly tweaked. But you can count on encountering the zucchini saut\u00E9, a Red Cat staple, along with green beans tempura, an addictive side dish with a dipping sauce of extra-zingy honey mustard - honey mustard on steroids."
,"You can count on a terrific pork tenderloin among the entrees. It is bathed before cooking in a sugar marinade, and served with morels. You can count on an expertly grilled shell steak. You can count on the rest of the entrees running a predictable but sensible gamut: chicken and duck; salmon or Arctic char; cod or black bass or such."
,"You can count on plates that are composed generously, with a bounty of vegetables and sometimes a whole extra dimension, like the richly satisfying vegetable risotto on which Mr. Bradley placed cod. And you can pretty much count on careful cooking. A skate wing was ideally crispy on the outside without being remotely dry on the inside."
,"The Red Cat opened in 1999, when it received one star in The New York Times from William Grimes. Its location, on a fringe of Chelsea, among a growing gallery scene, seemed much more remote then than now, but the Red Cat has never relied solely on its neighborhood for business. Its fluid, flexible nature is such that it seems - and is - in equal measures a local joint and a destination. It's the exceedingly rare place that can often take a reservation only a few days in advance and yet is almost always packed."
,"Some of the locals eat at the bar - and began doing so here long before that practice became a citywide fashion. The Red Cat was also ahead of the curve in grouping the wines on its list not by country but by character: \"Floral Whites,\" \"Sangiovese, Nebbiolo and Earthy Reds.\""
,"It has been a prolific sire: first of the Harrison, which has a slightly stiffer posture; then of the Mermaid Inn, which frolics casually in the surf; and most recently of Pace, which went full-on Italian and stumbled a bit. None have quite the Red Cat's easy confidence or irresistible spirit. Mr. Bradley even roasts and serves suckling pig here every Sunday. That's a Red Cat kind of thing to do."
,"Dishes at the Red Cat do not rise to sublime heights; that's not a Red Cat thing. Not all the desserts are as terrific as a rocky road sundae and an orange panna cotta, and a cookie sampler is entirely forgettable. The intensely friendly service can turn spacey, as when no one remembered to put a requested candle in the dessert of a friend who was celebrating a birthday."
,"But I always leave the Red Cat happy. It doesn't have the best this or the best that. It isn't a star pitcher or a marquee shortstop. It's an expert utility player, and maybe that's what red cat means - or should mean from now on."

"THE chef Kurt Gutenbrunner doesn't dawdle. He took possession of the TriBeCa space that would become his new restaurant Blaue Gans in late October, just a month and a half into the life of his new restaurant Thor on the Lower East Side. By early December he was already ladling out goulash and cutting slices of Sacher torte."
,"In the restaurant business, that sort of turnaround isn't just fast; it's borderline unfathomable. Then again, Mr. Gutenbrunner cut himself some breaks."
,"The space belonged to Le Zinc, and the few tweaks he and his collaborators made to its d\u00E9cor - still defined by a long zinc bar, scores of vintage posters, a curved ceiling and high-backed red banquettes - are so negligible that you find yourself wondering if he simply changed the locks and the name on the utilities and flicked on the lights."
,"The menu Mr. Gutenbrunner installed is brief, and it returns again and again to the same ideas and ingredients. Sausages have their day, sauerkraut gets a say and horseradish holds sway over a third of the dishes, or so it seems."
,"Blaue Gans (BLAU-eh gahnz), which means blue goose, happened so quickly because it required neither a grand plan nor a lavishly stocked larder. It's as much a land grab as an elaborately imagined restaurant. Mr. Gutenbrunner spotted and snatched a prime patch of real estate near his loft, then put that property to use with a straightforward Austro-German bistro that was virtually ready to go."
,"But as dashed-off as Blaue Gans may be, it perfectly suits a certain casual mood and a certain basic appetite, proving that a restaurant needn't be tremendously significant to be significantly appealing."
,"It's for impulsive diners who haven't taken the time to make reservations, which it doesn't accept. For impatient diners who don't want to pore over dozens of relentlessly inventive options, which it doesn't have. For exhausted diners who don't want to study a lengthy, abstruse wine list. Blaue Gans doesn't have that, either."
,"It has a modest regiment of rieslings and a small posse of gr\u00FCner veltliners. It has boiled beef shoulder with applesauce and, atop the applesauce, freshly grated horseradish. It has a smoked pork sausage with sauerkraut, mustard and horseradish. It has a pork and beef sausage with the same sidekicks."
,"Blaue Gans lets sexier restaurants canoodle with day-boat lobster and diver scallops. It flirts with trout, which appears twice on the menu. For an excellent appetizer, the fish is smoked and packed into a dense cake, the other layers of which include cr\u00E8me fra\u00EEche, red onion, apple and - get ready for this - horseradish."
,"For a satisfying entree, a whole brook trout is saut\u00E9ed, festooned with capers, fringed with carrots and bathed in creamed kohlrabi, a turniplike root vegetable. Mr. Gutenbrunner appears to be something of a trout savant: when I ate at Thor, one of the best entrees was brook trout, presented with creamed spinach and caper berries."
,"The similarity between that dish and the trout entree at Blaue Gans suggests the extent to which Mr. Gutenbrunner is cribbing from himself at his latest restaurant, referencing some of his best bits from previous ventures - Thor, Walls\u00E9 in Greenwich Village and Caf\u00E9 Sabarsky on the Upper East Side - and simplifying or rearranging them. You can almost think of Blaue Gans as a culinary version of Barneys Co-op, its merchandise marked down (though not all that much, and arguably not enough) and its niceties scaled back."
,"Service isn't entirely reliable. When a friend and I went for brunch one weekend, our waiter repeatedly forgot to bring us things we'd asked for: a napkin, her second mimosa, her third mimosa (she'd had a rough week). We couldn't always remind him because we couldn't always find him."
,"Dinners proceeded much more smoothly, perhaps because the gracious young Austrian man who works as a combined sommelier, host and floor manager was there. He also lent the restaurant an aura of authenticity with his pronounced accent and Alpine musings."
,"When I arrived one night, he was raptly watching the winter Olympics on a TV above the bar, discussing the beauty of the mountains and reminiscing about his home country. If ever I felt a hunger for schnitzels and strudels, along with a thirst for raindrops on roses, it was then and there."
,"Of the restaurant's many presentations of sausage, two were especially good. A pale pork and veal sausage, served with sweet mustard and a soft, salty pretzel, had the lightness of mousse. A mash of blood sausage and fingerling potatoes was molded into a circle and placed on a roomy bed of sauerkraut."
,"On the schnitzel front, a respectable pork Wiener schnitzel wore a crisp coat of egg, flour and breadcrumbs and came with a terrific potato salad, which was light on vinegar and heavy on fresh dill, an herb that doesn't get its due these days."
,"But a pork j\u00E4ger schnitzel was better. The meat had been dusted with flour and cooked with veal stock, cream, button mushrooms and bacon. It came with spaetzle, which the sommelier recommended we drag through the tawny sauce. What a wise, sweet man."
,"The food at Blaue Gans isn't exactly dainty, and when it veers in that direction, it winds up in an unremarkable place. Simple fillets of cod and Arctic char seemed less like fully formed dishes than like menu stretchers and sops to lighter eaters."
,"The restaurant does better with robust fare like venison, a recurring special, and pork belly, a menu fixture. It does wonderfully with desserts, one of the best of which is something called a kaiserschmarren, a spongy pancake sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with an apple compote."
,"In another standout dessert, a compote of huckleberries and lingonberries hides beneath a generous cover of meringue, the undulating shape of which is meant, I learned later, to resemble three peaks surrounding Salzburg."
,"The sommelier glanced longingly at it. Was he reconnecting with his native land? Or just looking forward to a reliably satisfying meal at the end of his shift?"

"WE often wind up associating restaurants with the life dramas and junctures they guided us through. I will always associate Devi with the 2004 presidential election. And I will always credit Devi with making the campaign seem less ugly than it was, with making it recede, if only for the duration of a plate of pyramid-shaped rice puffs, too golden, crunchy and airy to permit unpleasant thoughts."
,"It was in Devi that four companions and I gathered exactly a week before the election and inevitably made predictions. While the uncertainty of the race pressed down on us, we didn't feel it just then. We were too distracted and happy fishing creamy yam dumplings from a fragrant pool of salmon-colored tomato sauce that had been seasoned enticingly with cloves and cardamom seeds, cinnamon and red pepper."
,"It was also in Devi, two nights after the election, that a man at the next table could not resist treating everyone around him - strangers all - to a passionate deconstruction of what the returns meant, where the country was heading, the challenges and threats it faced."
,"But his soliloquy felt more like frivolous theater than an example of how heated and polarized so many voters had become, because nothing could seem too weighty in the golden glow of Devi's main dining room, where sheets of raw silk shimmer on the walls, servers glide past in what look like orange pajamas, and the scents of mint, cilantro and tamarind sweeten the air."
,"There are restaurants that bring you back to yourself and those that spirit you away. Devi belongs to the latter group, delivering a heady retreat even when the odds against such an escape are longest."
,"Devi works its exotic magic through its take on Indian food, more varied, multidimensional, nimble and surprising here than at the scores of samosa factories throughout these vindaloo-bewitched precincts, where a tandoor and delivery menu are sometimes all that a culinary entrepreneur needs to get by."
,"It casts its spell visually, by making you feel as if you have been lifted - lofted really - to a realm more enchanted than any blue or red state could offer."
,"Devi does not have the design budget or square footage of a Spice Market or a Megu, but it has a galaxy of brilliantly glowing glass fixtures - white, red, blue, yellow and green - that hang from the ceiling like gargantuan gemstones. It has a curved marble staircase that rises from the main dining room, each step flanked by votive candles, to a more intimate second floor that puts you at eye level with that sky of diamonds and rubies and sapphires."
,"Best of all, Devi has chefs, Suvir Saran and Hemant Mathur, who do not feel bound by your expectations for Indian food. Yes, there is chicken tikka masala on the menu, but you have to hunt for it, and if you ask your server for suggestions, he will steer you in less tired directions."
,"Toward the crispy fried okra, for example, which is dusted with ground mango peel, pomegranate seed and toasted cumin, for an effect so tangy and salty that this dish could easily oust potato skins or nachos as the new appetizer sensation at a T.G.I. Friday's. (I mean that as an unfettered compliment.)"
,"Or toward the cauliflower with ketchup. That is not, to be truthful, how Devi advertises the dish in question, but that is essentially what it is, and there is positively no shame in that. Manchurian cauliflower, to use the proper tag, pairs firm, crunchy florets with a tomato ketchup that has been spiked with garlic and chili peppers. It is entirely simple, crazily good and a fine example of Mr. Saran's laudable pragmatism: what matters is the bigness and seductiveness of the taste achieved, not the method for achieving it."
,"Mr. Saran and Mr. Mathur previously teamed at the Indian restaurant Amma, which they left last April. Devi reprises many of Amma's hits and pursues the same goal of placing Indian cooking, or at least putatively Indian cooking, on a higher plane of New York City dining."
,"That aspiration is perhaps most evident in an item available only on a seven-course tasting menu: a mash of calf's brain, green chili, quail eggs and pickled ginger that serves as the ethereal topping for a bruschetta."
,"But that aspiration is also clear in the quality of seafood and meat that Devi puts into the tandoor. On both of the nights I tried them, the jumbo prawns, seasoned with toasted chickpea flour, cayenne, lemon, ginger and garlic, had a wonderful texture: slightly bouncy on the outside, soft within. Lamb chops, which had been marinated in yogurt, garlic and ginger, were faultless."
,"Both the halibut and salmon at Devi are sealed and cooked in banana leaves and both emerged from their cocoons in splendidly moist form. But just when I was ready to pronounce Devi a master of all flesh, I waded into two different dishes - one with a fiery curry sauce, the other with a marvelous gravy of pistachios, saffron and cream - that included chunks of excessively chewy chicken. A beef entree - sirloin pounded into thin strips - was similarly tough and unappealing. In its bid for \"crispy,\" which was how the menu advertised it, it came up dry."
,"Devi wobbles from time to time, and the prices for a few dishes are rather high in relation to the portions. A few of the restaurant's uniformly courteous servers are prone to distraction and more eager to please than efficient at it. Almost all of its desserts proved disappointing. I found only one, the \"falooda,\" a parfait that combined strawberry and mango sorbets with coconut-lemon-grass milk, that I truly liked."
,"But there was much to compensate, including an unexpected standout: finely minced turkey with fenugreek leaves, spinach, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and onions. It packs so many tastes of India into a hash so sublime that I feel happier and calmer just knowing it exists."
,"I cannot guess whether, over the next four years, some of the acrimony of the past four months will lessen. But at least I know that if I need a vacation from the fighting and fretting, Devi is there for me."

"Diner"
,"85 Broadway (Berry Street), Williamsburg, Brooklyn; (718) 486-3077."
,"One minute our waiter was standing over us, in the usual tableau; the next he was seated beside us, not only reciting the night\u2019s menu but also scribbling it, in shorthand, on the paper that covered our table. That\u2019s Diner for you: shaggy, improvisatory and cheeky, much like Williamsburg - or at least, like Williamsburg when Diner opened there a decade ago."
,"The neighborhood has changed. And Diner? Not so much. A while back, Caroline Fidanza ceded the reins in the kitchen to Sean Rembold, who had worked beside her. But now, as ever, the cooking emphasizes seasonality, accessibility, comfort and correctness: the beef for a recent strip steak special ($32) was grass-fed. Diner was doing the Brooklyn tropes before they were Brooklyn tropes."
,"And it still does them with charm and skill, based on a recent dinner there, which I found more satisfying than a dinner not too long before that at Marlow & Sons, the most prominent of Diner\u2019s offspring, including the two Bonita restaurants."
,"A half chicken ($22) was impeccably cooked. Same for a fillet of halibut ($23). Neither reflected particular daring - that was left to an appetizer of grilled duck hearts ($11), by far the best dish of the night. The runner-up? Possibly a sorrel soup ($8) with such intensely smoky, porky accents that it tasted almost like a liquefied ham sandwich. I mean that as a compliment."
,"All of the desserts I sampled - chocolate cake, poundcake, lemon pie (each $8) - were good. There\u2019s a sophisticated wine list and carefully chosen beers. You can get an easy-drinking, refreshing Presidente ($4) from the Dominican Republican. You should."
,"Diner\u2019s setting - in a narrow, snug metal dining car from 1927 - remains irresistible. But its prices have risen sharply since the start, when an evening\u2019s soup special was, say, $3.50, and the chicken was $9. That\u2019s inflation, yes. But that\u2019s also what happens when a neighborhood itself ascends."

"I\u2019VE never fallen afoul of a Texas Ranger, but my first bite of the fatty brisket at Hill Country hit me like a Chuck Norris roundhouse kick to the head. I was stunned. Was I eating beef barbecue this ridiculously good in Chelsea?"
,"The New York-born pitmasters Robbie Richter and Lou Elrose shepherd brisket to perfection in big black smokers in the back of the restaurant. Alchemy, really, is what they\u2019re practicing back there. No other barbecue place that has opened in New York in recent years has gotten it so right, right out of the gate."
,"It\u2019s one of those multimillion-dollar joints: blaring music (live bands occasionally perform on the stage downstairs); a calculatedly weathered look that is more T.G.I. Friday\u2019s than Freemans; a fair number of communal tables that can be reserved for groups of eight or more."
,"If the vibe is new school, the service is not: meats, sides and drinks are dispensed at separate counters; a \"meal ticket\" is used to tally the total at the end of the meal."
,"Which brings us to that brisket, that exemplary specimen of Texas-style salt-and-pepper pit cooking Mr. Richter and Mr. Elrose practice. The fatty part - the deckle, sold as \"brisket moist\" (the less marbled part, the flat, is sold as \"brisket lean\") - should first be contemplated with nothing more than bare fingers and closed eyes. One should take a moment to appreciate the textural contrast offered by the ring of sweet-salty meat crust that surrounds the yielding, moist flesh, slick with fat, and the smokiness that never threatens to overwhelm the beef flavor. It is a thing of balance and of beauty."
,"Some meats are available by the piece, like links of chunky, dry sausage flown in from the legendary Kreuz Market in Lockhart, Tex., and whole game hens cooked on Lone Star beer cans. Everything else is by the pound: hammy pork chops cut from the rack; a few more cuts of beef including a supremely tender barbecued prime rib."
,"Side dishes, for the most part, don\u2019t spark a must-eat-more response. In the future, I will augment my meat pile with nothing more than the dead-simple cucumber salad and the smoky campfire baked beans. Desserts, like a jelly-filled, peanut butter-frosted cupcake, are best suited to those who want their sugar buzz delivered with as little pretense and refinement as possible."
,"The drink selection includes sweetened iced tea in Mason jars and a vast selection of overpriced mass market beers (Miller High Life runs $5). The whiskey selection is respectable, the wines an afterthought."
,"The verdict? Easy: Hill Country is one of the finest new barbecue spots to open in New York in quite some time."
,"Hill Country"
,"30 West 26th Street (Avenue of the Americas), Chelsea; (212) 255-4544."
,"BEST DISHES Brisket; prime rib; beer can game hen; Kreuz sausages; baked beans; cucumber salad."
,"PRICE RANGE Meats by the pound, $6 to $18; prime rib, $29. Some meats, like game hens ($10) and sausages ($5.25 to $5.50) are priced by the piece. Sides, in three sizes, from $3.95 to $16. Desserts, $4 to $6."
,"CREDIT CARDS All major cards."
,"HOURS 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday; 11:30 a.m. to midnight Friday and Saturday."

"text": [
"THE minute you heard that Keith McNally was dusting off Minetta Tavern - that musty, sputtering Greenwich Village relic from the late 1930s - you probably figured he\u2019d get the look and atmosphere right. This is a project perfectly suited to a restaurateur with a gift for breathing fresh life into familiar genres, for grafting the present onto the past."
,"You also knew he\u2019d conjure buzz. He always conjures buzz. Where Mr. McNally goes, models, movie honchos and magazine scribes follow, because they\u2019re sure to find themselves among other members of their slavishly fashionable tribe, coddled in an environment that\u2019s as much stage set as mess hall."
,"And maybe, just maybe, you counted on decent food. Even when his restaurants miss their mark, they usually reflect at least some culinary thought. He cares about cooking, more than he must. Balthazar, for example, has typically been about twice as good as it needs to be."
,"But were you prepared for a c\u00F4te de boeuf like Minetta\u2019s, a sublime hunk of glorious meat that you dream about hours later, pine for the next day and extol in a manner so rapturous and nonstop that friends begin to worry less about your cholesterol than about your sanity?"
,"And did you expect that Mr. McNally, with the chefs Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson, would come up with the best steakhouse in the city? That\u2019s what Minetta Tavern turns out to be."
,"For starters it\u2019s serving some of the most expertly aged, flavorful and exquisitely prepared prime beef in New York. This beef is showcased in one trailblazing burger and two titanic steaks, the c\u00F4te de boeuf for two and a bone-in New York strip, that have for two months now been the incessant talk of insatiable carnivores, who can\u2019t get enough of them."
,"Are you better off with the c\u00F4te de boeuf, which is more generously marbled with fat, or the strip, with its steelier, brawnier taste? You could ponder, discuss and dither over this question as long as you could any stimulus package, only it would be a lot more fun. You could dedicate half a dozen visits to Minetta in the service of a resolution and still it might elude you."
,"Or you could abandon the debate for a while and explore other areas of the menu - and you wouldn\u2019t be disappointed. Although little of the rest of Minetta\u2019s food rises all the way to the extraordinarily high level of the beef, much of it is terrific. Minetta\u2019s claim to being New York\u2019s best steakhouse rests in large part on its versatility."
,"While Sparks has a justly renowned strip of its own, it doesn\u2019t have appetizers as quietly sophisticated as Minetta\u2019s creamy mussel soup. While the best porterhouse on the best night at Peter Luger can be an amazement, there\u2019s no seafood there as fine as the tender, sweet lobster in a big, crisp salad at Minetta or as this restaurant\u2019s trout meuni\u00E8re, buttery and bedecked with crab meat. And at Minetta the servers don\u2019t bark at you."
,"Minetta\u2019s potatoes Anna, which are like a love affair between scalloped potatoes and hash browns, rival the best sides at Strip House, where the beef itself isn\u2019t in Minetta\u2019s league. Minetta has a succinct selection of American cheeses so accomplished you could mistake them for European - you don\u2019t get that at Keens. It doesn\u2019t charge tariffs as steep as Craftsteak\u2019s or the BLT empire\u2019s."
,"And with just 70 seats in two rooms, it feels more intimate than, say, Primehouse New York or Porter House New York. Yes, it\u2019s cramped and loud, but that\u2019s in keeping with the genre and, as such, a facet of its charm. Minetta captures the clubby, chaotic spirit of a handsomely timeworn saloon to a T: the long, heavy wood bar up front; the glowing tiers of liquor behind it; the tiled floors; the tin ceiling. Plus there are all those framed etchings of celebrities on the walls and the gauzy painted murals in the back."
,"Mr. McNally has buffed what needed buffing, added what needed adding - the dark red booths, for example, are new - and left the rest of the place intact. It\u2019s high-gloss nostalgia: McNally assoluta."
,"It finds him in a more ambitious mood than at other restaurants he\u2019s opened over the last decade, in terms of what\u2019s on the plate. Neither Pastis nor Schiller\u2019s Liquor Bar seek to do any food as superior as Minetta\u2019s meat, including the crisp lamb saddle and succulent veal chop."
,"And Morandi doesn\u2019t compete against the city\u2019s Italian standouts the way Minetta takes on the most prized temples of sirloin."
,"As Mr. McNally put this restaurant together with Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson, who are veterans of Balthazar and Pastis, the three arranged through the distributor Pat La Frieda to get their hands on the fantastic grain-fed Black Angus beef from Creekstone Farms, which has a richness that\u2019s indulgent without crossing into unctuous overkill as wagyu sometimes does."
,"They had Mr. La Frieda set up a special aging room where Minetta\u2019s strips, its c\u00F4te de boeuf and the rib-eye used in a blend (with short rib, brisket and skirt) for its much-ballyhooed Black Label burger are stored for six to seven weeks."
,"And in the kitchen they installed a high-temperature broiler that gives the meat precisely the char it wants. The steaks don\u2019t develop a surface that\u2019s too crunchy, which can happen at Luger, and they\u2019re not finished with an excess of butter, another Luger liability. They\u2019re spot-on - at least the ones on the \"grillades\" section of the menu, where the best cuts are clustered. A lower-priced bar steak elsewhere isn\u2019t prime or dry-aged."
,"Wrongly, the Black Label burger has received more public attention than the steaks, on account of its $26 price tag. It\u2019s without question a riveting experience, because burgers seldom pack the discernible tang and funk of aged beef. But for that same reason, it\u2019s unsettling and arguably too intense."
,"Besides, the Minetta burger, a blend of short rib and brisket, manages a comparable juiciness at a price of $16, including a heap of crunchy, salty, addictive fries. And with a burger, you look to be comforted, not awed."
,"Comfort, all in all, isn\u2019t this restaurant\u2019s strong point. Good luck penetrating the bodies around the host station after 7:30 p.m. And good luck nabbing a reservation any time between 7 and 10 unless you have and use an inside phone line, which I didn\u2019t."
,"Minetta has additional drawbacks. The desserts need slight improvement, especially the coarse, flat-footed sorbets, though you\u2019ll have no complaint whatsoever with the sumptuous chocolate dacquoise."
,"The wine list, better than those at older and squarer steakhouses, can nonetheless be frustrating, with too few accessibly priced reds that beckon you."
,"Should you want to tread more lightly than the $36 strip and the $90 c\u00F4te de boeuf - both generously portioned and neither out of line with the cost of prime beef these days - the trout is $24. An equally fine grilled dorade is $21. A large carbonara-style pasta dish that\u2019s better than three-quarters of what I had at Morandi is $16. The excellent fried pig\u2019s trotter, served over lentils, is $19."
,"Given his name and his stardust, Mr. McNally didn\u2019t have to provide this reasonable a path through his newest restaurant, not even now. But at Minetta he\u2019s made a series of decisions that go admirably beyond the bottom line. And he\u2019s made the kitchen the focal point of a resuscitation that\u2019s ultimately about eating more than anything else."

"NOVIT&#193; is a designer shoe box of a restaurant around the corner from Gramercy Park, a basement room on East 22nd Street, a perfect neighborhood trattoria."
,"It has excellent pasta. In any other metropolis in North America, it would be well known among that city\u2019s best places to eat. In many cities, it would sit atop the heap."
,"But in New York, a lot of people have never heard of the place. (How cool is that?) This is testament to the strength of our restaurant scene, to the sheer abundance of good restaurants here. And Novit&#225; is a very good restaurant."
,"The restaurant\u2019s walls are the color of old chamois. There are heavy windows along the street that look out onto the sidewalk as if they were part of a stage set for Audrey Hepburn. Flowers sit on their sills."
,"Beneath them is a clientele that is perfectly New Yorkish: old and young and middle-aged, white and black, riotously Italian and fashion-forward, Mitteleuropean and plain."
,"For the uninitiated: Novit&#225; opened in 1994. (For those with elephantine memories, the space was once Huberts.) Marco Fregonese was an owner then as now, also the chef. He had cooked at Mezzaluna and Mezzogiorno before opening Novit&#225;; he started his career in Milan cooking for Gualtiero Marchesi, whose restaurant was the first in Italy to earn three Michelin stars."
,"Mr. Fregonese knows from fancy, as Ruth Reichl pointed out in a review of Novit&#225; in The New York Times, published in July 1995. He seemed \"swept away by the desire to be creative,\" she wrote. Ms. Reichl awarded the restaurant one star."
,"It has gotten better since. Mr. Fregonese has moved away from some of the ornate, fussy preparations that used to mark his cooking and toward a plain and hearty style well suited to longevity."
,"A plate of gramigna alla carbonara, for instance, thin strands of curled pasta with eggs, pecorino romano, guanciale and black pepper, arrives on the table as a riot of simplicity, a four-member noise band. It is outstanding, firm and pliant, salty and sweet, slick and sticky and rich."
,"A simple appetizer plate of grilled portobello, shiitake and oyster mushrooms, with shavings of Parmesan over the top, is similarly plain - and similarly packed with flavor. (Shiitakes stuffed with shrimp and scallions, then pan-fried, are more complicated - and very hard to stop eating.)"
,"Breaded baby eggplant baked with tomato, mozzarella and Parmesan is like something out of a Bensonhurst fever dream. If served on a hero there, it would give veal a run for its money."
,"Asparagus gratin you probably shouldn\u2019t eat till spring, so as not to encourage FedEx farming, but it\u2019s wonderful all the same, bright beneath its butter, nutty with cheese."
,"And a small plate of hand-cut prosciutto with airlifted melon slices tastes like Manhattan\u2019s past made living, like a delicious early dinner at Mezzogiorno, in fact, with Marlboro smoke drifting out through the open windows on Spring Street and people arguing about Mary Boone."
,"There was quite a bit of meat on that plate, for the record, and no shortage of melon. The portion sizes at Novit&#225; are notable. They may surprise those who make it their business mostly to eat at the city\u2019s newest kitchens, people with a genetic predisposition to this year\u2019s model, people with cats named Umami and Speck. You won\u2019t go away hungry from Novit&#225;; the plates are food, not art."
,"To this point, Mr. Fregonese has clearly thought about the visual composition of each dish. But none of the food at Novit&#225; looks as if someone spent a lot of time moving it around with his fingers, making it just so. That, too, is welcome."
,"So is the restaurant\u2019s wine list, which is of an agreeable size and breadth, with some nice reds out of the Veneto (including a nice \"baby Amarone\" from Allegrini, 2006) and Tuscany (try the vino nobile from Avignonesi, 2006) that offer good flavor in the $50 range."
,"The pastas are just ridiculous: perfectly prepared, full of flavor, a rejoinder to low expectations."
,"You might try a bright and floral pesto over the long cavatelli pasta known as strozzapreti, or priest chokers, studded with pine nuts and salted with Parmesan. Or a plain penne with roasted tomatoes, basil and mozzarella that tastes of triangular perfection, summer on a midwinter plate. Black spaghettini with mixed seafood and a spicy tomato sauce is worth a mini-fad in itself, with pasta that is toothsome and a sauce made rich with lobster."
,"Three more: little ears of orecchiette with spicy sausage and broccoli rabe in tomato sauce; papparadelle with lamb rag\u00F9 and earthy porcini mushrooms; rigatoni with seared tuna, black olives, tomatoes and oregano. These are like postcards from an Italy of the mind, color swatches to recolor your world."
,"Indeed, the best way to order them is as a table, asking the waiter if each person might get a portion of the other\u2019s order. This is a very nice way to eat dinner."
,"Main courses are less successful, though by no means off-putting."
,"Seared tuna with a black pepper crust and lemon sauce may be the parachute pants of entrees, but it is perfectly done fish for that, under velvety lemon sauce. A filet mignon with more of that asparagus and a dark Barolo sauce is banquet food, but of the sort that forgives the banquet."
,"But there is also a splendid veal Milanese with rucola and tomates, crisp and juicy, the sort of dish you could eat once a week, and a rolled chicken breast stuffed with spinach and prosciutto that revives confidence in both chicken breasts and stuffing them."
,"Eat these, with some fresh berries for dessert, some lemon-mint sorbet, a creamy mille foglie, cemented with custard, and savor a glass of amaro or a well-drawn espresso. Giuseppe Delpiano, the host and an owner of the restaurant, sits at the bar eating his own dinner as around him conversation gurgles, an urban stream. There is one older couple holding hands over their table. A man in a ponytail fiddles with his earring. Someone laughs."
,"At times Novit&#225; resembles the lobby of the Angelika theater, or a late afternoon ride on the M102."
,"It provides a jury pool that would understand completely what brought you to do what the prosecutors say you did. It is hard to eat there and not think yourself lucky."

"text": [
"\"I WANTED an unassuming way to slip into the shallow end of the pool of New York City restaurants,\" wrote Gabrielle Hamilton in an essay in Food & Wine magazine about her decision to open the restaurant Prune in 1999. \"I wanted to cook for my neighbors.\""
,"Prune did not quite work out that way. Sure, Ms. Hamilton's downtown neighbors came. But so did uptown strangers and pilgrims from outside the city and even the state. So did other chefs and food writers, enchanted by the lack of pretense in Ms. Hamilton's preparations, by the simplicity and gusto of what she served: sardines on Triscuits, warm monkfish liver on toast, p\u00E2t\u00E9 sandwiches and deviled eggs."
,"Prune quickly morphed from adorable notion into formidable influence, a small restaurant with a large footprint. The proof was in the emulation, in the other restaurants that rightly began to accord homey cooking as much honor as haute cuisine: not a novel ethic, but one that Ms. Hamilton gave fresh currency."
,"The proof was also in the long line outside the door late Sunday morning, when I most recently visited Prune, and at a corner table inside. There sat Chelsea Clinton, huddled over what looked like Prune's Dutch-style pancake."
,"Smart woman. That pancake is as big as a Frisbee, fluffy as a cloud and so ethereally appealing that Aunt Jemima and Mrs. Butterworth would probably fight to the sticky death over the privilege of coating it. But real maple syrup beat them to it."
,"With brunch, as with much else, Prune does not mess around. It offers about a dozen variations of the bloody mary, including one with lime, tequila and smoked chipotle that tastes like the torrid love affair of an angry tomato and a margarita. Each of these bloody marys, our server explained, comes with a glass of Red Stripe beer as a chaser."
,"A beer chaser? Before noon?"
,"\"Goooooood morning!\" she trumpeted by way of explanation and response. And a very good morning it indeed turned out to be."
,"It is easy to see why Prune is so widely and fervently loved. It has mirth to spare, moxie to burn. It listens to its own muse and operates by a credo of whimsical indulgence."
,"Consider another of the brunch options, the Monte Cristo. Prune takes a familiar and therefore instantly comforting triple-decker sandwich of ham, turkey and Swiss cheese and ups the ante. The sandwich is battered with egg and milk and briefly grilled in butter before being deep-fried. Then, when the sandwich's excesses would seem to have reached their zenith, powdered sugar is sprinkled generously atop it."
,"Or consider a dinner appetizer of sweetbreads, also battered, also deep-fried. Decadent on their own, they are nonetheless paired with a sauce of bacon, capers, caper juice and copious butter for an ultimate effect that one of my friends exultantly called Kentucky-fried sweetbreads."
,"When we had finished them and there was nothing left but three buttery capers, a server asked if we were done. We hesitated, at which point she said, \"I would take my fingers and go like this,\" advising us to swipe and lick. That is the Prune way."
,"But as easy as it is to appreciate Prune, it is just as easy to oversell it. Prune has limitations and frustrations, none of them insignificant."
,"Dining here can be like a game of Twister, because the roughly 30 seats are so tightly wedged, even by Manhattan standards, that the situation verges on comical. At a corner table one night, three of us had to rise and walk into the vestibule so that our fourth could go to the restroom."
,"The same attributes that make Prune endearing can also feel like self-conscious shtick. Prune is a mood, and you have to be in it. The servers, all friendly and droll, wear pink shirts that match the menus. There are packages of Alka-Seltzer on the bar at brunch. There is a rigorously enforced no cellphone policy, laudable but perplexing given the din and loud music."
,"\"You'll notice we're very lowbrow, and our utensils don't match,\" one server volunteered. I had not paid that detail much heed, but once I did, I wondered all the more about the prices, which have risen over the years. The average entree is about $25."
,"The duck is $30, expensive in terms of the ambience of the restaurant and the quality of the dish. Both times I tried it, the roasted breast was extremely tough. The braised leg was stringy, which was also true of braised rabbit legs, another entree. I had the sense that the hordes that almost ceaselessly descend upon Prune sometimes tax the tiny kitchen."
,"But a whole grilled branzino was terrific, the flesh moist and the presentation blessedly simple. It came with half a lemon to be squeezed over it and coarse salt to be sprinkled atop it. The brief list of entrees was rounded out by a rib-eye, a pork chop and beef short ribs, each done in a fairly straightforward manner, each pleasurable but uneventful."
,"Like entrees, desserts were a mixed bag, from a wonderful mix of chocolate and tangerine granitas to a hard, chalky cocoa meringue. But when it came to smaller dishes, listed in the top section of the dinner menu and on a separate page of bar snacks, Prune could seemingly do no wrong."
,"These dishes included those fabulous sweetbreads; roasted marrow bones served with grilled bread and sea salt; a Parmesan omelet that carried the salty kick of so much of the food; ball-shaped homemade lamb sausages with a pink and juicy core; and a plate of buttered bread, Garrotxa cheese and salted red onion, the makings of the kind of snack you might put together at home at 2 a.m. and enjoy more than anything more fanciful you had eaten that day."
,"And then there was brunch, which Prune does so well, from expert omelets to a fantastic coddled egg mixed with ribbons of poached chicken and cream. No wonder Ms. Clinton paid a visit."
,"She sat with a cellphone and a BlackBerry on the table in front of her. This was clearly not the tableau Ms. Hamilton had in mind when she envisioned cooking \"for the woman upstairs in my building who sells pot,\" as she wrote."
,"But it was a well-deserved testament to what Ms. Hamilton has achieved."

"DON\u2019T be fooled: Saraghina is a restaurant in pizzeria\u2019s clothing. Yes, the front dining room is dominated by a wood-burning oven; the pizzaiolo learned his craft from Michele Iuliano of Luzzo\u2019s; and the menu, a single sheet of paper, lists little more than six Naples-style pizzas ($10 to $15)."
,"But really, Saraghina is a trattoria - you just need to seek out the specials, an appealing selection of salads, antipasti, pastas and seafood dishes that change daily. It\u2019s home cooking, or at least the kind of uncomplicated food some stylish Italians might throw together at their weekend house."
,"Not that there\u2019s anything clumsy about a dish like the swordfish carpaccio ($13). Thin medallions of local swordfish are drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt, thyme and pink peppercorns. It\u2019s an elegant start to a meal."
,"That is, if it\u2019s available. The specials change so often it would take dozens of visits to gauge the kitchen\u2019s repertory. Outside of the pizzas, you don\u2019t go back to Saraghina for your favorites. You go back to try something new."
,"Which might be grilled octopus salad ($13); or mussels steamed with garlic and crushed pepper ($11); or burratina ($11), a thick slice of burrata drizzled with olive oil and served with a pile of grape tomatoes. It tasted like summer. Or baby artichokes ($10), which were saut\u00E9ed in white wine and olive oil and served with a leafy pile of shaved fennel."
,"On one visit prosciutto and melon ($11), that antipasto warhorse, was a dazzling display of exquisite ingredients, the sweet and salty flavors brightened by sprigs of mint."
,"(Most of the produce is from Greenmarket vendors, but the herbs are even more local: they\u2019re from the Bed-Stuy Farm, a part of the Brooklyn Rescue Mission.)"
,"You also go back to linger in the dining rooms, which are unexpectedly pretty. The restaurant is in a part of Bedford-Stuyvesant where the side streets are lined with row houses as stately as any anywhere else in Brooklyn."
,"But Saraghina has the casual elegance of a beach rental on the North Fork, all whitewashed walls and battered furniture. It was cobbled together from a storefront, a garage and a neighboring garden."
,"To get from one dining room to the other you twist your way through the pantry, a narrow hallway lined with dinner plates and the juice glasses the restaurant uses for wine."
,"The design is the handiwork of Massimiliano Nanni and his wife, Paola Citterio. Mr. Nanni also owns Piadina, in the West Village. The couple live a few doors away and say Saraghina is the neighborhood restaurant they always wanted to open."
,"Edoardo Mantelli, the restaurant\u2019s other owner, is the chef. Until this spring Mr. Mantelli was the creative director of the fashion line Tocca, where he\u2019s still a partner. Since he was a boy in Milan his fantasy was to run a restaurant, and his enthusiasm shows."
,"But the dishes don\u2019t always measure up. One night the spaghetti with rag\u00F9 di pesce ($14) - a rich sauce of simmered bluefish and fresh tomatoes - tasted intensely of the ocean. But the spaghetti with bacon and tomatoes ($14) was disappointingly bland. And I would skip the mushy panzanella ($8)."
,"A dinner at Saraghina is so enjoyable it\u2019s easy to forgive the occasional inconsistency. Which is why the neighborhood has taken to it so strongly. Saraghina has been busy since it opened in June, even though it hasn\u2019t been easy for those who don\u2019t live in Bedford-Stuyvesant to stop by: the restaurant has no phone and it does not take reservations."
,"The best thing to do is just go."

"EVERYTHING is new in New York save for that which is old, and when something goes from one to the other, the transition can be sudden and surprising: a wet foal that\u2019s suddenly distinguished and large, a horse that rides with the weight of history on its back."
,"Ten years ago, for instance, Strip House wasn\u2019t a venerable steakhouse in Greenwich Village, with familiar cheesecake pictures on the scarlet flocked walls and 40-year-old men drinking Cutty at the bar, reminiscing about 30th birthdays spent there, how they\u2019d stolen the racy Frette napkins off their table and taken the marrow bones the restaurant used to serve along with the steaks home to their dogs, now dead. They\u2019d done the same thing at 32, at 36. (Maybe at 39, too? Such a history to the place!)"
,"No, in 2000, Strip House was just new and strange, a kind of simulacrum of a bordello restaurant in a city that might have been anywhere in America. All that was aged about it were the steaks and the sepia-toned portraits of forgotten opera stars on the wall, left over from when Strip House was Asti, an Italian joint made famous by its role in the Tom Hanks vehicle \"Big.\" It was a dining room for the green."
,"William Grimes, in a review for The New York Times that year, wrote that Strip House wasn\u2019t so much a steakhouse as \"a catalog of hip references to the idea of a steakhouse.\" He awarded the restaurant one star."
,"Now it deserves two. Age has given David Rockwell\u2019s design for the room a kind of gravitas, and with it the restaurant has gained some of the clubby appeal you used to be able to find at places like Gino, on Lexington Avenue, which has a similar layout, or in the bar room at \"21.\" (As at \"21,\" there is great fun to be had in snooping about the place. In addition to portraits of Viennese strippers, torch singers and ancient celebrities on the walls, there is a signed portrait of Thurgood Marshall near the bar.)"
,"The service is professional and attentive, with none of the gruff theatricality that attends tables at Sparks or Smith & Wollensky. The wine list is comprehensive and interesting, with reds to surprise palates and draw the attention of expense-account auditors alike."
,"And the food is generally marvelous, the steak often superb. Strip House belongs to Peter and Penny Glazier, the restaurant tycoons who own Michael Jordan\u2019s in Grand Central Terminal, as well as mimeographed Strip Houses in Las Vegas and Houston, in Florida and New Jersey. The Glaziers buy a lot of meat. They use the leverage to secure excellent product."
,"John Schenk, the executive chef at Strip House since 2006, makes sure of its use. He has his line cooks grill the steaks tight and well, with a thick crust of salt and pepper that highlights the deep flavor of the beef. (The marrow bones may be gone, but a sprig of rosemary, stuck into a bulb of roasted garlic, still accompanies each steak.)"
,"Best is the New York strip, served on the bone and out of the short loin of the cow, 20 ounces of muscle that make up the bottom part of a porterhouse. The strip is the restaurant\u2019s signature steak: beefy and rich, tender, with the kind of giant, mineral-tinged flavor that puts elbows on the table and calls as much for martinis as for wine."
,"Paired with a colossal ovoid of potatoes fried in goose fat, and a vat of creamed spinach made chic with black truffles, Strip House\u2019s strip is on its way to becoming an iconic New York City meal, perhaps one day to take a place near the pan roast at the Oyster Bar, or the Grand Marnier shrimp at Shun Lee."
,"There are other cuts available: a catcher\u2019s mitt of rib-eye, with perhaps a little too much fat for the Michelin inspector; a wide porterhouse served in the Peter Luger style, with butter sauce; and a few versions of filet mignon, including a special that comes grilled on the bone. These last do as filet mignon generally does. They disappoint. (If someone insists on the filet, insist on a boat of Mr. Schenk\u2019s excellent b\u00E9arnaise sauce to go with it.)"
,"But a veal chop will work for anyone interested in a glorious reminder why we love grilled veal: it\u2019s deeply sweet and tender beneath its crust, pale and pink, trembling good. And a rack of pungent, delicately fatted lamb in a mustardy bread-crumb crust, served with a soft white-bean stew, makes a strong case for inclusion on any table. It\u2019s grassy and rich, not at all gamy, with beans that melt in their sauce."
,"And while the goose-fat potatoes and truffled creamed spinach represent the top of the side-dish heap, it may also be worth considering a cone of golden fries; or a plate of crisp, gigantic onion rings; or even a baked potato with bacon, Cheddar, chives and sour cream that\u2019s straight out of the American past. Steamed broccoli? It sits on the table like a prude. Douse it in b\u00E9arnaise immediately."
,"There is more than steak and potatoes on the menu, of course. A terrific bibb lettuce salad with Stilton vinaigrette sits on the appetizer list beside roasted bacon with arugula and Russian dressing, a sorority girl in her first low-cut blouse, across a table from a trader in broadcloth and loosened tie. Both are great. There is an irreproachable shrimp cocktail, a better crab cake, with bright corn salsa and a spicy r\u00E9moulade, even a beet salad that\u2019s worth a strong look. (Avoid the house-made jerky, leathery and wan.)"
,"Yellowfin tuna with a green peppercorn sauce and a kind of sushi-bar vegetable roll is ruddy and rich, well cooked beneath a coating of sesame seeds. But pan-seared red snapper in a basil sauce, with a nice run of artichokes, pancetta and fingerlings beneath it, isn\u2019t going to win the year\u2019s sustainable-seafood award. For that, it\u2019s still deeply flavorful, flaky and clean. You can always have lobster, fat beneath its hard shell, an Atlantic success story, a mess worth making."
,"Desserts are of course available, but really there is but one to order, and for the table: a 24-layer chocolate cake the size of a stunt gift in the Neiman Marcus catalog. It\u2019s neatly covered in ganache, fantastically rich and good, the size of a house cat formed into a triangle. Chase your portion with an espresso or tumbler of bourbon, maybe a glass of milk. It might make you feel younger."

"REVISITS"
,"Sushi Yasuda"
,"204 East 43rd Street; (212) 972-1001."
,"Not many restaurants are best visited at the very start of the evening, before an air of festivity stirs."
,"But that\u2019s precisely when you should enter Sushi Yasuda. Around 6, the half-dozen chefs behind the blond wood counter stand in a silent, still phalanx, purposeful as soldiers, humble as monks, their white uniforms immaculate. They symbolize the militaristic precision and quasi-religious ardor with which this restaurant approaches its mission."
,"That mission is sushi, and there is no shortage of Manhattan restaurants that specialize in it. But from the time Naomichi Yasuda opened Sushi Yasuda more than eight years ago, when William Grimes awarded it three stars in The New York Times, it has been among the best. And a recent visit suggested that there\u2019s been no slippage, no drift."
,"My companion and I sat at the counter and turned ourselves over to one of the chefs, ours alone for the first 20 minutes. We ate whatever he gave us, except for one dish we ordered off a short list of the night\u2019s specials: a flash-fried soft-shell crab ($19), easily the lightest, most flavorful soft-shell crab I had all summer."
,"He presented us with two kinds of mackerel (Japanese and Spanish), two kinds of salmon (from Alaska and from New Zealand), and later on two kinds of eel (sea and freshwater). The pieces tended to come like that, two at a time: clam with oyster; fatty blue fin tuna with even fattier blue fin tuna."
,"Each was marvelous, seasoned in its own way, never too flamboyantly. Wasabi played a minor role, citrus a major one, and the restaurant used coarse salt to terrific effect."
,"In truth the variety wasn\u2019t a surprise, though we could have requested more adventurous selections. The pacing was fleet. Sometimes one round of sushi came just 90 seconds after the previous round. Had we not made clear that we didn\u2019t want to be rushed, we might have been in and out in 50 minutes - too hurried for the price. For 36 pieces of sushi in all, or 18 for each of us, we paid $159."
,"That works out to under $4.50 a piece, reasonable given what lesser establishments charge, this one\u2019s polished d\u00E9cor and serene ambience, and its attentive but unobtrusive service."
,"Tables and \u00E0 la carte ordering are possible, and maybe better for groups. But I recommend going with just one other person, or alone. The men in white and the first-rate fish they\u2019re cutting give you all the company and diversion you need."

"TO: Graydon Carter, grayisgood@vanityfair.com"
,"FROM: Frannie Von Furstinshow, furstinshow@guccipucci.net"
,"First, dear, a quibble: Demi? On the cover? Back when she was large (and naked!) with a child destined for a nutty celebrity-spawn name, it made sense. But if \"Bobby\" is a comeback, I went to a state university."
,"Now, applause: Waverly. Love it. I laugh when I hear it called a restaurant, as if it were anything so mundane and (apologies to Demi) pregnable. How can they call it a restaurant when the official phone number yields a recording that doesn\u2019t take messages or even acknowledge that the place has opened? Of course, we\u2019ve all been eating there since early November. It just isn\u2019t open to anyone and everyone."
,"Someday it will surely have to be. Someday the people who know you and the people who know your key staff members and the recognizable or attractive people who take the trouble to stop in, willing to submit to a visual once-over and try to make a reservation in person - someday there won\u2019t be enough of these people to fill the seats, and you\u2019ll have to take all callers and comers, and it will all be so much different."
,"But for now, well, we have a Toots Shor\u2019s of our own, a Stork Club without the plumage. I think back to that night in London at the Groucho Club (remember how everyone was trying not to stare at Martin Amis\u2019s new teeth?!) and how we agreed that New York needed an English gentlemen\u2019s club that didn\u2019t take English gentlemen as members."
,"You could write the book on playing coy. Or at least a key chapter in the annals of playing coy. The big red letters saying \"preview\" on not only every page of the menu but also on every page of the wine list? The constant public nattering about the Edward Sorel mural not being done? (Looked good to me.) The refusal to let newspapers and magazines take pictures beyond the front bar area, as if there were still dropcloths and paint cans scattered about?"
,"Brilliant. Just brilliant. I heard you even held your ground with The Times, denying the photographer access to the dining rooms. How in the world will they get around that?"
,"I dropped in the other night. My eleventh visit, I think. (Is there some kind of frequent flier program? Kidding! But if there is. ... ) That front bar area was poignant: all those strivers with Blackberries but without reservations, waiting for a tap on the shoulder that would never come. I heard a woman who did have a reservation - her table wasn\u2019t ready - tell her companion that they should sell it on eBay. There\u2019s a traitor in our midst."
,"No wonder so many want in so badly. If our house up in Rhinebeck had the coziness that Waverly does, I wouldn\u2019t make Herbert go up there alone as often as I do. The quaintly uneven wood floors, the low ceilings, the four fireplaces, the red banquettes: Waverly is like a rumpled, wrinkled dowager who found some late-in-life glamour, who got a great tailor and the best laser peel money could buy."
,"What was it before? Ye Waverly Inn? Graydon, ye somehow managed to keep the sense that it dates back to the 1920s while losing the mustiness. Everything about it, and everyone in it, glows. I even like the rear garden, with its high glass ceiling, handsome brick walls and forest of plants. Siberia was never so verdant."
,"I\u2019ve dawdled in getting to the food, because I hate to complain. But does it have to be this good, Graydon? Isn\u2019t that a strategic blunder?"
,"When word gets out that your chef, John DeLucie, is doing some of the best tuna tartare in town (all that creamy avocado and zingy heat!), plus a hefty and juicy pork chop, a classically blissful Dover sole, an addictive clam chowder, a gorgeous fillet of wild salmon (with those adorable little beluga lentils) and such feloniously fatty short ribs, won\u2019t there be even more lemmings tumbling down the steps from Bank Street and through the door?"
,"Won\u2019t we have some of the Little Owl and August crowds on top of the folks who\u2019d mow down their grandmothers for invitations to the Vanity Fair Oscar party?"
,"Sure, this isn\u2019t attention-getting cuisine. It doesn\u2019t take much to steam an artichoke or whip up chicken liver mousse. The world could do without one more fris\u00E9e aux lardons, one more blizzard of goat cheese (yes, I saw, Humboldt Fog goat cheese) on one more landscape of crimson beets. Apple crisp and cr\u00E8me caramel aren\u2019t paths to Epicurean glory."
,"But I\u2019ve been to Cafe Cluny, and it doesn\u2019t pull off a similarly modest menu of comforting favorites as well. Except for the dull chicken pot pie and the humdrum crab cakes and the functional strip steak, Waverly is like the cooking I\u2019d do at home, if I had the time and, well, O.K., if I could cook."
,"And it\u2019s not just me who thinks so. I heard this drone at a nearby table prattling to his hostages - excuse me, friends - about the crispness of the Amish free-range chicken\u2019s skin and how the bird had real flavor and how the moist meat was a barometer of a conscientious kitchen. What was he? A restaurant critic?"
,"He actually asked if the $55 macaroni and cheese with shaved white truffles could be ordered without the truffles. He didn\u2019t get it. The whole point is the comedy of getting - and being seen getting - something so absurdly costly. No truffles, no deal."
,"No kidding, Graydon, Waverly is sweet. It\u2019s not just about an A-list daisy chain of writers, actors, models. It\u2019s not just about ringside seats to the latest Perelman-Barkin smackdown."
,"It\u2019s about the ease and privilege of being among people who reflect your brainiest, prettiest sense of self. And it\u2019s got manners: the bartenders stand on their toes and peek over the front row of revelers to try to take drink orders from the bleachers, no matter who\u2019s there. The waiters smile as they deliver those wonderful biscuits, even if the recipients don\u2019t have boldface names."
,"It\u2019s like a gracious nightly party, Graydon, that you host in spirit even when you\u2019re not there in person, though you often are. It\u2019s just a few steps from your home to the Waverly, to this vision of Greenwich Village as it\u2019s often been romanticized but probably never really was."
,"I don\u2019t have to read your answers to a Proust Questionnaire to know how good that must make you feel."
