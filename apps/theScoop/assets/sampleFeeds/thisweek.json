This series presents all of his features but one, mostly in newly restored prints, and traces the evolution of his work from experimental fiction (beginning Friday with \u201CCasual Relations\u201D and \u201CLocal Color\u201D) to sharply insightful essay films (beginning Sunday with \u201CRock Hudson\u2019s Home Movies,\u201D \u201CFrom the Journals of Jean Seberg\u201D and \u201CThe Silver Screen: Color Me Lavender\u201D).",

"description": "Without James Levine, who has faced the reality of his health problems and will step aside this September as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, these three Carnegie Hall programs are not as they were anticipated. At least two, however, are sure to be rewarding. On Tuesday the superb violinist Christian Tetzlaff plays Mozart\u2019s Rondo in C, Harrison Birtwistle\u2019s new Violin Concerto and Bartok\u2019s Concerto No. 2, with Marcelo Lehninger conducting; the in-demand Andris Nelsons conducts Mahler\u2019s Ninth on Thursday. Maurizio Pollini, who was to have been soloist in a fascinating program on Wednesday, withdrew some weeks ago because of illness. The tame replacement program, conducted by Roberto Abbado, offers a Haydn symphony, Bruch\u2019s Violin Concerto No. 1 (with the reliably exciting Joshua Bell as soloist) and Beethoven\u2019s Fifth. At 8 p.m.",

"Spend a few minutes - or even a few hours - wandering the halls of your average New York apartment building, and you are not likely to see much more eye-popping action than the collecting of newspapers, the wrangling of children into chunky strollers and the delicate dance of polite avoidance that most locals consider all that is required of neighborly intimacy."
,"To watch \"The Hallway Trilogy\" by Adam Rapp is to enter an alternate universe. In this series of connected plays being performed in rotating repertory at the Rattlestick Playwrights Theater (or in all-day marathons on Sunday), a nondescript passageway in a Lower East Side tenement building becomes a carnival of the desperate, the grotesque, the outrageous. Mr. Rapp, a relentless provocateur whose numerous plays have paraded a feast of bad behavior before the city\u2019s more adventurous - and strong-stomached - theatergoers, never ceases to extend himself in the presentation of the grisly extremes of human experience."
,"\"The Hallway Trilogy\" contains some of Mr. Rapp\u2019s most sensitive and mature writing, in the finest of the plays, \"Paraffin,\" set on the day of the big blackout of 2003. All three feature exciting casts of talented young actors: Julianne Nicholson (\"This\"), Maria Dizzia (\"In the Next Room, or the Vibrator Play\"), Jeremy Strong (\"New Jerusalem\"), Katherine Waterston (\"Bachelorette\"), Louis Cancelmi (\"Blasted\") and many more."
,"But what is most distinctive and most memorable about Mr. Rapp\u2019s new work is what is often most distinctive and memorable about Mr. Rapp\u2019s writing: the gross-out factor. I never expected to see a man who has soiled himself strip down and clean up onstage. Or a pregnant woman\u2019s water breaking. Attempted murder by machete? Maybe. The lancing of plague-ridden boils? Definitely not."
,"I can now say I have witnessed all this, and much more, thanks to \"The Hallway Trilogy.\" For the last play in the series, \"Nursing,\" set in the future, theatergoers are provided with germ-dispelling face masks. Air sickness bags would probably be more apposite."
,"\"Rose,\" the first play, directed by Mr. Rapp, is comparatively tame, but then it takes place in 1953, and thus treats only the kind of outrageous, self-destructive behavior that \"Mad Men\" has made such a fetish of accentuating, namely smoking. It\u2019s an intermittently appealing but often contrived comedy-drama about the colliding hopes and fraying dreams of the inhabitants of an apartment building ruled by an ogre-ish superintendent (the effectively repellent Guy Boyd). His alacrity at changing the locks of renters in a pinch gives Mr. Rapp a convenient excuse for having the play\u2019s characters idling in the hallway for implausibly long stretches."
,"The super\u2019s name is Eugene O\u2019Neil, and a central strand of the episodic plot turns on this oddity. Rose Hathaway, played with a smiling fragility by Ms. Waterston in one of the trilogy\u2019s standout performances, is an aspiring actress convinced that the playwright - whose death has been reported in the morning papers - has in fact falsified his demise and is hiding out in this run-down building. (The set, by Beowulf Boritt, precisely captures the borderline-squalid milieu.)"
,"Nervous and perhaps just a little unhinged, Rose gets no response when she knocks on her idol\u2019s door but lingers in hope, passing the time with the other residents of the floor: Orest, a cornet-playing Russian who cutely mangles the language (\"I thank you from the basement of my heart\"), played by a funny, poker-faced William Apps; the ardent young Communist Jerry (Mr. Cancelmi, excellent), who is obsessed with the comely Mary (Ms. Nicholson) from upstairs; Megan (period-perfect Sarah Lemp), Mary\u2019s sweet-natured schoolteacher sister, who pines for Orest; and a silent fellow referred to as Marbles (a capering Nick Lawson) for his playful habit of dispensing these at whim."
,"Although Mr. Rapp\u2019s dialogue often bristles with humor, only Ms. Waterston truly has a chance to shape a whole character, suggesting a sensitive heart and confused mind suffering underneath her character\u2019s pert, ingratiating exterior. Most of the others either skirt stereotype or veer into unmotivated behavior: Would Ms. Nicholson\u2019s poised, beautiful Mary, who came within inches of landing a millionaire, really give herself to her slobbish super with such casual carelessness? Would Orest move from friendly overtures to Rose to brutally cruel rejection of Megan so easily?"
,"Mr. Rapp creates characters more grounded in truth in the contemporary play, \"Paraffin,\" well directed by Daniel Aukin. The passage of 50 years has obliterated any appealing period details in the architecture, although the inhabitants are of the same slightly bohemian, aspiring middle classes. This more focused play centers on the strained marriage of the pregnant Margo (Ms. Nicholson) and her would-be rocker husband Denny (Mr. Apps), he of the soiled jeans, found unconscious outside the couple\u2019s door as the play begins."
,"Denny\u2019s younger brother Lucas (Mr. Strong), a veteran of the war in Afghanistan who is in a wheelchair, lives two doors down. Soured by his experience, he strafes anyone who comes within his limited firing range with sarcasm and abuse. The primary victims are his roommate Marty (Mr. Boyd, in happier mode), a middle-aged gay man whom he savagely ridicules for his affinity for younger black guys (Stephen Tyrone Williams is a charmer as the pickup); and Rahel (a flustered, touching Ms. Dizzia), a married Israeli woman living upstairs with whom Lucas aggressively flirts and then viciously taunts when she rejects his advances."
,"But Lucas reveals a more complex nature in the play\u2019s moving central scene, set during the first hours of the blackout. Mr. Strong, who exudes a sullen poisonousness when his character is in attack mode, strips away the harsh exterior to expose the sad truth about Lucas. His anger has less to do with his injury than his long-hidden love for his brother\u2019s wife. Ms. Nicholson is terrific too in this extended scene, confessing at one point that her life with Denny has become so troubled that she wishes she had never become pregnant."
,"There are also fine contributions from Sue Jean Kim, as Margo\u2019s friend Dena, and Danny Mastrogiorgio as Kevin, the super, who has a shy crush on Dena. Mr. Rapp captures with an uncharacteristic depth of feeling the mood that overtakes all the characters in the liberating atmosphere of the blackout: the sense of being \"stuck in our lives,\" as Dena puts it, accompanied by the yearning for change that may never be acted upon when everyday habits return."
,"The delicate pitch of this scene, the highlight of the trilogy, is light-years away from the preposterous dystopia of \"Nursing,\" directed by Trip Cullman and set midway through the current century. The tenement hallway has become a \"museum of disease and nursing,\" all infectious diseases having been wiped off the planet. Ms. Kim plays tour guide with the perky demeanor of a 1960s stewardess and the wardrobe to match, suggesting that we will still be recycling the same fashion fads well into the future. (The excellent costumes are by Jessica Pabst.)"
,"The audience is cast as visitors who have come to watch a volunteer, Lloyd Boyd (Logan Marshall-Green, deserving an actor\u2019s equivalent of the Purple Heart), be infected with various pathogens, including the Black Death and cholera - particularly fun, with Lloyd vomiting while writhing in pain from diarrhea on the toilet."
,"Mr. Rapp\u2019s bodily-fluid-drenched gorefest pounds home the idea that while bacteria and viruses may have been eradicated, the disease that is mankind still wreaks havoc. But there remains a cadre of extremists who believe that fatal toxins need to be returned to the world so that people will again know suffering, and thus empathy will be reborn."
,"One of Lloyd\u2019s nurses is among this radical crew (Ms. Dizzia, in a grim role), bent on liberating Lloyd and spreading the latest of his grisly diseases to humanity. To which one can only say - and not for the first time during \"The Hallway Trilogy\" - ugh!"

"There are not many fixed verities in the world of the theater, but one of the few is that when A.R. Gurney returns to home territory - writing about the manners and morals of the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant upper class - the results will most likely be gratifying. Mr. Gurney\u2019s \"Black Tie,\" which opened on Tuesday night at the 59E59 Theaters, is one of this prolific writer\u2019s most enjoyable plays in years, a modest but effortlessly engaging comedy about the generational shifts in the subset of humanity Mr. Gurney has been writing about with warmth, humor and insight throughout his career."
,"Directed with a deft touch by Mark Lamos, Primary Stages\u2019 production is adorned by a suave comic performance from Daniel Davis, portraying an exemplar of a certain class of man from the early-to-mid-20th century. He\u2019s the father of Curtis (Gregg Edelman), who is the father of the groom at a wedding in upstate New York. Curtis\u2019s dear old dad is also, strictly speaking, dead, although this does not prevent him from offering copious advice to his son about how a proper wedding is properly brought off."
,"Very little about the nuptials of his grandson strikes this most unquiet ghost as even remotely appropriate. The funky Adirondacks hotel might be fun for a weekend lark, but for a family wedding? Appalling. (John Arnone\u2019s set is precisely observed, striking the right note of tacky, woodsy quaintness.) And what\u2019s this about the bride and the groom writing their own vows? Even the term \"rehearsal dinner,\" for which Curtis is trying to dress as the play begins, strikes his father\u2019s ear with a shrill sound."
,"\"How do you rehearse a dinner?\" he sniffs in dismay. Once upon a happier time, the event was called the bridal dinner."
,"This paternal apparition appears to have been conjured by Curtis via a kind of sartorial osmosis. Curtis has decided to wear his father\u2019s old tuxedo to the dinner, although Dad does not approve of this modish term, either. An ample dispenser of arcane information, Dad sternly tells Curtis that \"we call it a dinner jacket,\" the word tuxedo having been coined rather too recently and spread to all classes of society with unfortunate haste."
,"\"One of those bold New York gestures which caught on,\" he says. \"Like brunch.\""
,"Mr. Davis, exuding the essence of easygoing gentility, brings innumerable witty inflections to his performance, investing single words with resignation, surprise and various shades of disapproval at the sad falling off of standards in the world. Even the pauses are rich with unspoken protest, or simple bewilderment, as when Curtis gently fills him in on the complicated racial makeup of his grandson\u2019s fianc\u00E9e, who is part African-American, part Vietnamese and part Peruvian."
,"\"I\u2019ll have to let this sink in,\" Mr. Davis says after an elaborate series of pauses, winning one of the evening\u2019s biggest laughs."
,"The colloquies between Curtis and the ghost of his father constitute the play\u2019s funniest and most appealing scenes. Mr. Davis is such a continual pleasure, dispensing tart bons mots by the dozen, that you might regret his frequent disappearances during the scenes in which Curtis interacts with his actually present family. (Mr. Gurney isn\u2019t quite able to smooth over the awkwardness of these entrances and exits.)"
,"But Mr. Edelman is fine company as the genial Curtis, as is the appealingly dry Carolyn McCormick, perfectly cast as Curtis\u2019s forbearing wife, Mimi. She is of the same class and upbringing but gently pushes against her own hidebound instincts. She has noticed that her husband has been sounding strangely like his father at times lately, which is none too pleasing to Mimi, since she and Curtis\u2019s father never got on well. She thinks the tuxedo - er, dinner jacket - is rather too formal for this evening\u2019s event, too."
,"Curtis stands firm, even when their daughter, Elsie (Elvy Yost), makes wry jokes about Curtis\u2019s being mistaken for a waiter. But real drama unfolds when Elsie brings news that a friend of the bride, an up-and-coming standup comic, has offered to perform a set at the rehearsal dinner, which will severely curtail Curtis\u2019s opportunity to wax lyrical in the speech he has been carefully shaping with the input of his father\u2019s ghost."
,"Curtis\u2019s disappointment boils over into outrage when Teddy (Ari Brand) bursts into the room to inform his parents that he and his fianc\u00E9e, Maya, have just had an explosive fight, with the supposedly snobbish behavior of his parents a central matter of contention."
,"This emotionally climactic scene doesn\u2019t ring as true as much of what has come before. It doesn\u2019t seem plausible that Teddy would be quite so forthcoming in detailing all of Maya\u2019s many objections to his parents on the eve of the wedding. (Bad manners, surely, even from a generation more forthright about airing grievances.) Mr. Gurney might have felt the need to give his play a suitably pointed climax, but his style is most appealing when it is most gentle, and something about this scene of wedding jitters, with its confrontation and tidy reconciliation, feels forced."
,"Nor is it necessary for Mr. Gurney to gin up drama to give his light comedy some manufactured angst. Without the scene of family fireworks, \"Black Tie\" is insightful and touching in its depiction of a man welcoming back that ghost many of us have to banish consciously from our minds as we grow older, the voice of a parent (or grandparent) that becomes an internal barometer of the propriety of our behavior, whether we like it or not."
,"And then, for too much of this climactic scene, there\u2019s the absence of the play\u2019s most entertaining character - Mr. Davis\u2019s friendly, admonishing ghost. He does at last make a welcome return, however, to give his son a final piece of friendly advice, one proving that underneath the seemingly elitist exterior - underneath that perfectly cut dinner jacket - beats the heart of a true gentleman."
,"BLACK TIE"
,"By A. R. Gurney; directed by Mark Lamos; sets by John Arnone; costumes by Jess Goldstein; lighting by Stephen Strawbridge; music and sound by John Gromada; production stage manager, Matthew Melchiorre; production supervisor, PRF Productions; associate artistic director, Michelle Bossy.

"Total fearlessness is not a requirement for embarking on an acting career. But it is definitely a necessity for essaying the role of the dying gorgon Flora Goforth in \"The Milk Train Doesn\u2019t Stop Here Anymore,\" a curious, rather curdled 1963 play by Tennessee Williams."
,"In Olympia Dukakis, the star of the new Off Broadway revival directed by Michael Wilson at the Laura Pels Theater, the Roundabout Theater Company has found an actress with the fortitude to risk ridicule in this fitfully moving, patchily eloquent but often preposterous drama about the loneliness and fear that can attend our going forth into the great unknown. Fortunately, Ms. Dukakis also possesses the talent to make the effort worthwhile."
,"Strangely, her ferocious, vanity-free performance is most entrancing when most absurd. Consider the scene in which the aged Flora, ravaged by disease and drugs but still capable of mustering the coquettish vanity of the showgirl she once was, emerges to entertain a dinner guest in full kabuki regalia, swathed in a silk kimono, her matted gray hair covered by pillows of black locks."
,"Smiling coyly, wagging her head in persuasive mimicry of a winsome geisha, Ms. Dukakis\u2019s Flora swoops and poses and flutters her fans before her stunned audience of one, as if performing before the imperial court of some bygone dynasty. (\"Don\u2019t tell me we\u2019re having a Chinese dinner,\" cracks her bewildered visitor.) The display is at once macabre, hilarious and weirdly touching, as the frail, harsh-tempered woman who has been braying like a donkey for much of the evening is transformed into a sensual seductress."
,"Macabre, hilarious and weirdly touching more or less sums up Ms. Dukakis\u2019s performance, although a host of other adjectives might also be applied to her multihued portrait of a woman who has married and buried four husbands but cannot face the truth when the reaper comes to escort her from life\u2019s banquet."
,"Fortunately for Flora, a celestial usher arrives in the comely form of Christopher Flanders (Darren Pettie), a poet and sculptor of mobiles - perhaps they were fashionable in the 1960s? - who scrambles up the goat path to Flora\u2019s Mediterranean mountaintop aerie with the mission of easing her passage into eternity. As Flora learns to her discomfort when she does some reconnaissance with a local gossip known as the Witch of Capri (Edward Hibbert, camping like there\u2019s no tomorrow for him either), Chris has gained the nickname the Angel of Death, bestowed for his habit of arriving on the doorstep of ailing dowagers with fat purses shortly before their demise."
,"The role of Flora, also known as Sissy, has not served actresses particularly well. Hermione Baddeley starred in the original Broadway production, but only for the two months it ran. A rewritten version that opened less than a year later, starring Tallulah Bankhead and Tab Hunter, fared even worse, closing after only five performances. At the height of her flamboyant 1960s glamour, Elizabeth Taylor belly-flopped big-time in the hootably bad (but also hootably good) movie version, titled \"Boom\" (don\u2019t ask), which featured Richard Burton, then her husband, as Chris and No&#235;l Coward - of all people - as the Witch of Capri. (The role was written for a woman and portrayed by Mildred Dunnock in the original production.)"
,"Ms. Dukakis does not entirely avoid shipwreck in this woozy vessel. As the mood darkens, and Flora must embrace impending death in the arms of her spiritual chaperone, things become moderately mortifying. Flora\u2019s acerbic exchanges with her secretary, Blackie (Maggie Lacey), and the sniping Witch give way to passionate clinches with Chris and panting invitations to join her in bed."
,"But for two-thirds of the play Flora is amusing if abrasive company, and Ms. Dukakis invests her with a bullying bravado that commands attention even when the play\u2019s static nature and more lurid excesses threaten to derail it. For Mr. Wilson\u2019s production, featuring a set (by Jeff Cowie) that\u2019s overly literal for a play poised at the blurry divide between realism and symbolism, is not always as persuasive as Ms. Dukakis\u2019s redoubtable Flora. (Mr. Wilson, a Williams specialist, first directed the play with Ms. Dukakis as Flora at the Hartford Stage in 2008.)"
,"With his sullen good looks and easy sexual charisma, Mr. Pettie has at least half the necessary attributes for Chris Flanders. But there is nothing of the mystic about him, and if we are to take Chris seriously as a missionary of mercy to desperate mortals at the portals of death, some spiritual aura (however ersatz) is necessary. (In Mr. Pettie\u2019s defense, even the most luminously spiritual actor probably couldn\u2019t make palatable floridities like Chris\u2019s accusation that the Witch is \"the heart of a world that has no heart, the heartless world we live in.\")"
,"As Blackie, to whom Flora is dictating her memoirs at all hours of the day and night, via a specially installed sound system, Ms. Lacey has the crisp efficiency and emotional reserve of the \"Vassar girl\" Flora derisively calls her. But the performance has a jerky quality, perhaps understandably, as Blackie moves from subjugation to defiance to sensual abandon in the arms of Chris. The wary inner warmth that might stitch the whole together never comes across."
,"Mr. Hibbert makes a full five-course meal of his brief scenes as the catty Witch of Capri. He, at least, is unburdened by the responsibility of any heavy lifting relating to the play\u2019s more ponderous ideas about the lost and lonely finding solace in the gloaming. His simpering snobbishness is a continual pleasure, a well-stocked candy store of bitchery. \"I can\u2019t go back to Capri in a dinner jacket before sundown,\" he huffs in outrage when Flora wants to give him the heave-ho."
,"By no means does \"Milk Train\" represent Williams at his most dramatically or lyrically assured. But it is enlivened by the scabrous humor and forthright frankness (at times crudeness) about matters physical that feature in many of his later, mostly derided and little-revived plays. Flora can be seen as an older iteration of the conniving Alexandra Del Lago, a k a the Princess Kosmonopolis, of \"Sweet Bird of Youth,\" from a few years before. (That play returns to Broadway in this, the centennial year of Williams\u2019s birth, with Nicole Kidman in the lead role.) A worldly operator who looks on every relationship as a transaction in which she is determined to get the upper hand, Flora has a razor-blade tongue whose bloodletting is often bawdy and funny."
,"But while Ms. Dukakis renders with broad, almost Borscht Belt humor the vulgar aspects of the character, she shades her performance with haunting glimpses of deeper feeling, as Flora relives both the most shameful episodes in her past, like her cruel indifference to the death of her first husband, and the most ennobling, her transporting love for her last."
,"The spectacle of Flora\u2019s gross but vital humanity in abject terror before its extinction cannot fail to move. Most of us are capable of cruel deeds as well as the rapture of requited love, and we will all know the terrible moment when there will be time neither to redeem the mistakes nor relive the joys."

"It takes two hours to watch \"Molly Sweeney\" at the Irish Repertory Theater. But you\u2019ll spend much more time thinking about it afterward. A deeply moving meditation on hope, change and despair, it\u2019s a compelling piece of theater, one in which the ending applause is only the beginning of the play\u2019s effects."
,"Molly, who has been blind almost since birth, starts off by recounting her life, one blessed with friends and a recent marriage. Her ever-enthusiastic husband, Frank, embarks on a plan to restore her sight and seeks out Mr. Rice, a once-promising eye surgeon who has gone into near-seclusion. \"What has she to lose?\" Mr. Rice asks as he agrees to operate on her. That question will haunt them all."
,"In the play, which had its New York premiere Off Broadway in 1996, the three characters tell their tales directly to the audience in intertwined monologues, never addressing one another. It\u2019s a risky form, particularly in an age that worships spectacle. But Brian Friel, the playwright, is a masterly storyteller. As in his similarly structured \"Faith Healer,\" the drama here remains strong as events unfold, leading to a play as tense as it is wonderfully written."
,"Just as remarkable is Mr. Friel\u2019s tendency to force subtle shifts in words, particularly those to do with sight, which take on multiple meanings throughout the script. In the same way, stories that were told for laughs show themselves to be eerie foreshadows. It\u2019s an uncanny feeling for an audience, when what once seemed cheerful turns chilling."
,"Geraldine Hughes as Molly, Ciaran O\u2019Reilly as Frank and Jonathan Hogan as Mr. Rice handle their monologues with confidence. While at times a silence or pause would speak with more authority than words, Charlotte Moore\u2019s direction sacrifices such moments for the sake of a steady pace. It\u2019s an entirely reasonable, if occasionally lamentable, tradeoff."
,"For the careful viewer \"Molly Sweeney\" is an astonishing work, one that acutely examines its characters and asks us to make similar observations of ourselves. Not least important, it\u2019s a highly entertaining play, often delivering laughs while posing its questions. Those laughs soon fade away, as laughs will. Those questions, however, stay with you."
,"\"Molly Sweeney\" continues through March 13 at the Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org."

"If you think you know all you need to know about Norman Rockwell, think again. \"Norman Rockwell: Behind the Camera\" at the Brooklyn Museum is a revelation. It is no secret that Rockwell relied on photographs to achieve the seeming naturalism of his paintings. But the extent and sophistication of his use of photography from the late 1930s on will come as a surprise to many of his fans and detractors."
,"Rockwell did not shoot his pictures, but employed professional photographers, including Gene Pelham, Bill Scovill, Louis J. Lamone and others who remain unidentified. But Rockwell did orchestrate every other aspect of studio sessions. He found and bought props; recruited friends, acquaintances and relatives as models; constructed sets; and conceived scenes like a Hollywood movie director. He might have missed his calling. He could have been another Frank Capra, director of the inspirational sob-fest \"It\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\""
,"Organized by the Norman Rockwell Museum and Ron Schick, a guest curator, this exhibition presents more than 100 black-and-white photographs, most of which have never been seen in public before. Along with the prints, which are the product of a recent two-year project to digitize almost 20,000 negatives from the Rockwell archives, are magazine covers and magazine and book pages with reproductions of Rockwell\u2019s illustrations."
,"There are 17 paintings and 10 drawings included, which is more than enough to show what was gained and what was lost in the translation. While the paintings have a sensuous physicality that photographs lack, many of the photographs have a chilly psychological subtlety that is muffled in the paintings."
,"Studying the differences is fascinating and often amusing. Consider \"University Club,\" a Saturday Evening Post cover in which a lanky sailor, leaning against the base of a looming gray stone facade, chats up a perky young woman in a tight red dress. In three studio photographs the sailor, viewed from the side, towers over the woman, and the fabric of his trousers clings like silk to his left buttock. The girl appears comparatively mousy. It could be a study for one of Paul Cadmus\u2019s homoerotic servicemen paintings."
,"In the final illustration of the magazine cover (the actual painting is not in the show), the sailor\u2019s pants are looser, and the woman\u2019s curves have been amplified. Her posture is more coquettish, and he seems less louche. It would be interesting to know how conscious Rockwell was of shifting the dynamic in a more conventionally heterosexual direction. But if only because they give a more ambiguous impression, the photographs are much more interesting than the final illustration."
,"It is as if Rockwell had an inner Mr. Hyde whose noirish vision his Dr. Jekyll was always having to expurgate. \"Salesman in Swimming Hole,\" a Saturday Evening Post cover from 1945, shows the head of a cheerful, balding man bobbing above the surface of a country pond. He has hung his clothes on a hanger at the edge of a concrete abutment and placed his shoes in the grass at the water\u2019s edge. His car is parked on the road above, where he left it when, evidently, he got the idea of cooling off on a hot summer day."
,"The photographs, in which the happy bather does not appear - he was shot in a studio where assistants poured buckets of water over his head - suggest a darker situation. Leafless trees indicate a colder season. In one of the photographs, a beauty, there are two cars on the road, and an anonymous, possibly sinister, figure looks down from above, as if to confirm the results of a nefarious plan. With its shadowy atmosphere, it could be a murder or suicide scene - less Capra than Hitchcock."
,"Not all the comparisons are so loaded. In many photographs the interest is in the model\u2019s visible effort to hold an exaggerated pose or expression of happiness, sadness, astonishment, bemusement, fear or sympathy. \"Framed\" (1946) - the actual painting in this case - shows a rotund museum custodian carrying an empty picture frame that turns him into a living portrait profile. In the painting, executed with old-master panache, including lots of palette knife action, he seems affably oblivious as he strides past real paintings on the museum wall behind him."
,"The man in the photograph has a distinctly less friendly mien, and his feet are supported at the toe of one and the heel of the other, so that he appears to be walking, though he is actually motionless. As in many other paintings, the reality of the model dissolves into the theatrical fiction of his painted doppelg&#228;nger."
,"Rockwell was not proud of relying on photographs. He considered it a form of cheating, a necessary evil by which to substantiate his unreal, sentimental fantasies. Other painters have been less shy about using photographs. The American modernist Charles Sheeler did not disguise his dependence on photographs, and photorealists like Chuck Close and Richard Estes have made the look of photography essential to their paintings."
,"But the staged photograph had to wait for the faux film stills that Cindy Sherman began making in the 1970s to come into its own as a respected fine-art genre. Laurie Simmons, Gregory Crewdson and a host of other canny artificers of photographic fantasy followed. Thanks to them, it is now possible to view Rockwell\u2019s photography not only as a means but also as an arresting end in itself. Rockwell must be rolling in his grave."
,"\"Norman Rockwell: Behind the Camera\" is on view through April 10 at the Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park; (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org."

"Like other major American museums, the Metropolitan was slow to recognize photography, but Alfred Stieglitz gave it a big push in the right direction. In 1928 this Photo-Secession pioneer donated 22 of his own works to the Met. They were the first photos to enter the collection."
,"A few years later, in 1933, Stieglitz made a larger gift of more than 400 works by his contemporaries: Edward Steichen, Paul Strand, Clarence White, Gertrude K&#228;sebier and many of the other photographers he had promoted in his New York gallery, 291, and his influential journal, Camera Work."
,"The museum\u2019s stunning \"Stieglitz, Steichen, Strand,\" mostly drawn from the collection, gives us just the big three - the impresario and his two greatest photographer discoveries. (Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, arguably his best find in any medium, appears as a portrait subject.) They were a contentious group, if you could call them a group at all. Steichen made his mark in the early years of 291, while Strand appeared toward the end of the gallery\u2019s run. In between Stieglitz was preoccupied with other art forms, notably abstract painting and sculpture."
,"Organized by Malcolm Daniel, the curator in charge of the Met\u2019s photography department, \"Stieglitz, Steichen, Strand\" clearly delineates the strengths and weaknesses of its three distinct personalities. (Each has a gallery to himself.)"
,"And though the pictures come from the collection, the show has an impressive story arc about photography\u2019s coming of age. The exhibition segues from Steichen\u2019s hazy, nostalgic Pictorialism to Strand\u2019s crisp, forward-looking still lifes and cityscapes, with justly famous examples from each category."
,"Stieglitz\u2019s own transition to a more clean-lined, geometric style is well documented in the first and largest gallery, with a rich selection of New York City views from early and late phases of his career. Other highlights include his piecemeal portraits of O\u2019Keeffe and his cloud studies, or \"Equivalents.\""
,"\"Winter, Fifth Avenue\" (1893), taken with a hand camera on a Midtown street corner in blizzard conditions, romanticizes the city (and the photographer\u2019s place in it). So does \"The Terminal,\" a picture taken the day after the storm; it shows a carriage driver watering his horses in the bitter cold, producing great clouds of steam. Stieglitz made several prints from this negative, an unassuming street view that somehow encapsulates his deep loneliness. \"How fortunate the horses seemed, having a human being to tend to them,\" he wrote."
,"Nearly three decades later he photographed the city from on high, looking out the windows of his 30th-floor apartment in the Shelton Hotel and his nearby 17th-floor gallery, An American Place. Here the metropolis is brisk and orderly, if still a bit alienating, epitomized by the neat scaffolding of a fast-rising skyscraper in the distance."
,"The Met\u2019s show reaffirms that while Stieglitz was a great photographer, he was an even better cultivator of talent. In 1900 a 20-year-old named Edward Steichen paid a visit to Stieglitz on his way to Paris from Milwaukee. Just a few years later Steichen had made his name as a photographer and become Stieglitz\u2019s indispensable European liaison, bringing work by artists like C\u00E9zanne and Picasso to 291."
,"Although Steichen\u2019s shadowy nudes and foggy woods shared the fussy look of fin-de-si\u00E8cle painting, they were products of state-of-the-art photographic technology. He was a virtuoso printer, employing as many different techniques and pigments as necessary to produce the desired pastel-like effect. In the Met\u2019s three large exhibition prints of \"The Flatiron\" - the only ones known to exist - Steichen used a combination of gum bichromate and palladium to envelop the downtown landmark in Whistleresque mists of indigo and gray."
,"Back in Paris he lent a similar presence to Rodin\u2019s plaster sculpture of Balzac, photographing it on a moonlit terrace. He had already paid homage to Rodin in a remarkable portrait, printing from two negatives to create a m\u00E9nage of the artist, his \"Thinker\" and his \"Monument to Victor Hugo.\""
,"Steichen\u2019s flair for portraiture ensured a steady income stream and some excellent social connections. After World War I he worked as the chief photographer for Vogue and Vanity Fair; the Met has a smattering of these images, though its vision of Steichen is filtered through Stieglitz\u2019s collection."
,"For the same reason Paul Strand is represented by early work, which fortunately is superb. Under Stieglitz\u2019s direction he developed a precise, \"brutal\" (to use Stieglitz\u2019s word) aesthetic that was in tune with the radical modernism of the 1913 Armory Show."
,"The Met has several of Strand\u2019s stark cityscapes, \"Wall Street\" being the most famous example. (It\u2019s shown as it appeared in an issue of Camera Work.) \"Winter, Central Park, New York,\" with its tree-branch shadows crisscrossing a tundralike expanse of white, seems to abstract the loneliness of Stieglitz\u2019s snowy cityscapes. And \"Geometric Backyards, New York,\" taken from the rear window of Strand\u2019s family\u2019s town house on West 83rd Street, transforms a row of clotheslines into a Cubo-Futurist fantasia."
,"Strand\u2019s humanism - nurtured early on by his teacher Lewis Hine at the Ethical Culture School, and later apparent in his famous street shot of a blind woman - led him in a different direction. World War I was a factor. So was his falling out with Stieglitz, who had a flirtation with Strand\u2019s wife, Rebecca (and photographed her nude at Lake George)."
,"In 1929 Strand made a portrait of Stieglitz, who was having his own romantic issues. (O\u2019Keeffe was in New Mexico, getting close - or so he feared - to a friend\u2019s husband.) It\u2019s a complicated picture, full of frustrations."
,"The central dynamic of \"Stieglitz, Steichen, Strand\" is just as complicated. One might see this show as a tale of two prot\u00E9g\u00E9s moving on, Steichen and Strand outgrowing Stieglitz. But the story is told by Stieglitz, or at least inflected by his largesse."
,"\"Stieglitz, Steichen, Strand\" continues through April 10 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org."

"It\u2019s Edward Hopper time again at the Whitney Museum of American Art. A little more than four years ago the museum\u2019s 75th-anniversary celebration, \"Full House,\" devoted an entire floor to his work."
,"Now he\u2019s back, with \"Modern Life: Edward Hopper and His Time,\" a slightly snoozy, ultimately satisfying floor-filling display that opened on Thursday. As the title implies, it mixes Hopper\u2019s efforts with those of his contemporaries. It also beefs up the proceedings with a handful of major loans from nearby museums."
,"These include the voluptuous shell of glowing, orange-tinted space that is the Newark Museum\u2019s \"Sheridan Theater,\" which depicts one of the Art Deco movie palaces that Hopper so loved to paint. The scene is inhabited by a lone woman who watches the screen standing at the back of the house, her chunky figure contradicting the flowing architecture. Also here is the Neuberger Museum of Art\u2019s imposing \"Barber Shop\" of 1931, with its monumental shaft of sunlit white wall imbuing a manicurist reading a magazine with unexpected grandeur."
,"Loans aside, Hopper is part of the Whitney brand, a reliable box-office draw, as identified with the museum as Picasso is with the Museum of Modern Art. There are more Hoppers in the Whitney collection than anywhere else - some 2,500 works - thanks to a bequest from the artist\u2019s widow."
,"The show is largely a condensed version of one organized by Barbara Haskell, the Whitney\u2019s veteran curator, and Sasha Nicholas, its senior curatorial assistant, that traveled last year to Hamburg and Rotterdam. It mixes and matches 32 paintings and works on paper by Hopper with 40 efforts by nearly 30 artists and photographers whose lives overlapped with his. (He was born in Nyack, N.Y., in 1882 and died in his studio on Washington Square Park in 1967.)"
,"The curators might have dug deeper into the Whitney\u2019s Hopper vastness for a few more-unfamiliar, less-chestnutty works than some of those here. But it is hard to say. It may be in the nature of Hopper\u2019s art - and thus of exhibitions of his art - to leave you wanting."
,"With its supernal stillness, its disinterest in detail, its forthright brushwork and its seemingly impenetrable ambiguity, Hopper\u2019s art rarely feels on target or settled. He tends to avoid the reassuring rightness we expect from painting\u2019s greats. Rather than hit you between the eyes, his work tends to sneak around behind. One moment you\u2019re distracted and a little resentful; the next, you\u2019re hooked."
,"The hook is the strangely unreal realism. Hopper\u2019s paintings depict a fragment of the familiar world as a deliberate, even forced confluence of form, paint and light - a nearly abstract distillation in which little distinction is made between animate and inanimate. His paintings capture snapshots of life and hold them for eternity, but they can expand exponentially internally, stretched out by surfaces that are at once weirdly solid yet provisional, capable of being dismantled if studied over time."
,"This show accommodates such study by creating a cat\u2019s cradle of telling differences and similarities, proving once more that nothing illuminates an artist\u2019s work than something by a different artist."
,"It unfolds in five galleries, each with a different emphasis and cohort. Throughout, Hopper plays what might be called the straight man, offering quiet, repose and glacial surfaces."
,"The supporting cast ranges from the photographers Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand - with whom Hopper shared a penchant for monumentality - to Thomas Hart Benton, Reginald Marsh and Paul Cadmus, whose notion of form often seems shabby and overwrought next to Hopper\u2019s."
,"There is an emphasis on artists to whom Hopper was close: John Sloan (1871-1951), the Ash Can realist who was an important mentor early in his career; Guy P\u00E8ne du Bois (1884-1958), who flavored his own implicitly classical treatment of the figure with a dash of caricature; and Charles Burchfield (1893-1967), a more visionary interpreter of American life than Hopper, who was also lumped together with American Scene painters (like Benton, Marsh and perhaps Cadmus)."
,"Off the elevator Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand\u2019s 1921 \"Manhatta,\" possibly America\u2019s first avant-garde film, flickers on the wall. Inspired by Walt Whitman\u2019s lyrical odes to the city, it is a great opener, even if - pardon the anthropomorphizing - the nearby Hoppers seem a bit taken aback. In Hopper\u2019s 1908 view of a regal tugboat, rendered in terra cotta pinks, even the rosy smoke emerging from its black smokestack feels solid. And the implacable form in his \"Queensborough Bridge\" is as much an immense four-legged dinosaur as a symbol of modernity."
,"The city - especially at night - dominates the first two galleries, where Hopper\u2019s work is grouped with efforts of Stieglitz, Strand, Sloan and P\u00E8ne du Bois. His three trips to Paris - made from 1906 to 1910 - are acknowledged in the small \"Le Bistro or the Wine Shop,\" which suggests an allegiance to the grace of Corot and Monet. Next to it hangs some all-American alienation in a pre-Paris work full of Hopper\u2019s future: a grisaille study of a man sitting by himself in the front row of a theater, waiting for the show to start."
,"In \"New York Interior,\" a woman in a corset and crinolines sits on bed mending as if preparing for a night on the town or the stage. Her outstretched pose is reminiscent of both the ballet dancers and bathers of Degas, whom Hopper admired. One of the Whitney\u2019s least familiar Hoppers is the 1912 \"American Village,\" in which we look over a window ledge to a luminous patch of street, lined by stores and dotted by people and cars. It could be by Walker Evans."
,"Gaston Lachaise\u2019s big bronze nude waves you into the next gallery, but you may only have eyes for the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s \"Night Windows,\" where once again you overlook the action. This time it is a glowing interior visible through a curving set of windows framed in near darkness: nothing too racy, just a woman bending over to pick something up."
,"Hopper takes a back seat in the next gallery, where four of his watercolors of buildings and boats hang with images by different Precisionists. They include Sheeler\u2019s 1932 \"River Rouge Plant,\" a blockade of white forms and gray reflections; George Ault\u2019s \"Hudson Street,\" whose forms have the warm tones and brittleness of the Italian Primitives; and Charles Demuth\u2019s view of pharaonic grain elevators titled \"My Egypt,\" a phrase whose catch-in-your-throat exhilaration is more vivid than the actual image. The message here: Hopper may look old fashioned, but he wanted something deeper."
,"He finds it in the next and fourth gallery, where he and Burchfield meet for a moment in a series of poignantly restrained images of street scenes and white clapboard houses. Then Hopper peels off to various almost Surrealistic ruminations on solitude. In five paintings he posits single stage-set-like structures - a house, a gas station, a railroad watchtower, a storefront and then another - against vast expanses of forest or plain."
,"And in the fifth gallery the American Scene painters have a go at him. \"Sheridan Theater\" and \"Barber Shop\" hold their own, along with the better-known (if not necessarily better) \"A Woman in the Sun.\" It depicts a nude woman standing in her bedroom in a yellow rectangle of sunlight, looking toward the window it streams through as if facing her destiny."
,"\"Modern Life: Edward Hopper and His Time\" runs through April 10 at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street; (212) 570-3600; whitney.org."

"The Buddhist influence on art of the past 50 years is, like much else in the Buddhist worldview, immeasurable. \"Grain of Emptiness: Buddhism-Inspired Contemporary Art,\" at the Rubin Museum of Art, wisely doesn\u2019t attempt such a survey. Instead it offers up an eclectic, not-the-usual-suspects group of five artists: Sanford Biggers, Theaster Gates, Atta Kim, Wolfgang Laib and Charmion von Wiegand."
,"It may be a stretch to call Ms. von Wiegand (1896-1983) a \"contemporary\" artist, but never mind; her colorful abstract paintings from the 1950s and \u201960s are revelatory and relevant. And in any case this show takes the long view, interspersing the recent art with Himalayan works that date from the 12th through 19th centuries."
,"None of the five artists consider themselves Buddhists, but they all lean heavily on the religion\u2019s symbols, tenets and rituals. As implied by the show\u2019s puzzler of a title, the concept of emptiness, or \"shunyata\" in Sanskrit, is particularly important to them."
,"That word requires some clarification, because non-Buddhists will be tempted to interpret it as \"nothingness.\" In Buddhism \"emptiness\" refers to the interdependence of all phenomena. To put it simply, reality as we know it is an illusion because nothing can exist on its own."
,"It\u2019s also important, for this show\u2019s purposes, to distance emptiness and the void from some of their formalist associations. With few exceptions, pared-down imagery has little place in the works at the Rubin. The museum\u2019s chief curator, Martin Brauen, who organized the show, writes in his catalog essay that \"fullness of form, as manifested for example in a mandala, is emptiness, and emptiness is this fullness of form.\""
,"Ms. von Wiegand\u2019s paintings, for instance, are extravagantly full: of colors, symbols and spiritual directives. This artist, a friend of Piet Mondrian\u2019s who shared his interests in theosophy and neoplasticism, came to know Tibetan Buddhism relatively late in life. In the 1960s, while studying with the Tibetan guru Khyongla Rato, she started to incorporate mandalas, chakras and other Buddhist symbols into her abstract compositions."
,"At the Rubin you can compare the triangular designs in Ms. von Wiegand\u2019s \"Chakras\" (1958-68) with those in a 17th-century bronze Nepalese yantra, a decorative object used to bring focus to the mind. The painting\u2019s frenetic channels of multicolored squares, meanwhile, will have you meditating on Mondrian\u2019s \"Boogie Woogies.\""
,"Mr. Biggers also appropriates Buddhist symbolism in \"Lotus\" (2007), an enormous glass flower that hangs over the museum\u2019s spiral staircase. On its petals he has hand-etched rows of paper-doll-like figures, based on diagrams of slave-ship holds. In another place \"Lotus\" might evoke suffering and transcendence, but the Rubin\u2019s plush, decorous setting makes it look benignly ornamental."
,"In contrast, Mr. Kim\u2019s photographs articulate Buddhist thoughts without doing much in the way of art. His long-exposure photographs of hectic urban streets blur foot and car traffic while retaining architecture, an idea that\u2019s as old as Daguerre. And his digitally layered \"portraits,\" which collapse hundreds of facial images into archetypal Tibetan men and women, make the idea of selflessness almost too accessible."
,"The singers shown in close-up in Mr. Gates\u2019s video \"Breathing\" (2010) flow from Japanese mantras into African-American spirituals. All are members of Mr. Gates\u2019s Buddhist\/gospel chorus, the Black Monks of Mississippi, which he has been directing since 2008. Their cross-cultural chants fill the galleries, adding to, rather than distracting from, the other works. Performance also figures in the sculptures of Mr. Laib, which combine Minimalist forms with Buddhist rituals. \"Rice Meals,\" for instance, involves a row of brass plates holding small mountains of uncooked rice and hazelnut pollen."
,"During the show\u2019s installation Mr. Laib was a monkish presence, sitting shoeless on the gallery floor as he spooned the pollen from a jar. \"If you\u2019re not careful, the pollen is sliding down like lava from a volcano, and you have to start all over again,\" he told the museum crew."
,"The setup of his latest \"Milkstone\" (2010), a slightly hollowed white marble slab covered with a thin film of milk, was just as exacting. After pouring milk from a small ceramic pitcher onto the center of the stone, Mr. Laib used a moistened fingertip to drag the liquid out to the corners."
,"The whole process, which will be repeated daily by trained installers, was austere yet sensuous; it brought to mind not only the history of white monochrome paintings, from Malevich to Robert Ryman, but also Vermeer\u2019s milkmaid. \"If art is really good it can include everything,\" Mr. Laib says in one of the catalog\u2019s many koanlike statements."
,"That\u2019s food for thought. Still, it\u2019s probably best to think of \"Grain of Emptiness\" as an unorthodox sampling of Buddhism in recent art - one that supplements (but doesn\u2019t replace) well-known works by John Cage, Yves Klein, Agnes Martin, Brice Marden, Bruce Nauman and many, many others."
,"\"Grain of Emptiness: Buddhism-Inspired Contemporary Art\" continues through April 11 at the Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea; (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org."

"All sinking sensations should feel this sensational. When the H.M.S. Neverland goes down in \"Peter and the Starcatcher,\" the blissful exercise in make-believe that opened on Wednesday night at the New York Theater Workshop, it\u2019s the most enthralling shipwreck since James Cameron sent the Titanic to her watery grave in the late 1990s (and picked up a crate of Oscars)."
,"Mr. Cameron, of course, had digital magic, green screens, hundreds of extras and a $200 million budget at his disposal. The directors of \"Peter and the Starcatcher,\" Roger Rees and Alex Timbers, have a small stage, a ladder, some rope, thunder and lightning effects that might have been in use a century ago, and a cast of exactly a dozen. Yet for my money, going down with the Neverland is a heck of a lot more fun - and ultimately more convincing - than any big-screen equivalent."
,"Or any big-stage equivalent, for that matter. Adapted by Rick Elice from Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson\u2019s popular children\u2019s novel of 2004, \"Peter and the Starcatcher\" sustains a breathless air of adventure and a cocky confidence in its powers to enchant that elude most family oriented spectacles now on Broadway, including hits like \"Wicked\" and \"Mary Poppins.\" In relating the back story of how a sullen, skeptical orphan became the eternal boy known as Peter Pan, \"Starcatcher\" celebrates the leap of faith that occurs when we tell and believe improbable tales."
,"It seems apt, then, that leaping should be a major physical activity in this untiringly energetic production, which follows various heroic, evil and still-undecided characters on a tempest-tossed ocean voyage from England to a mysterious island. People leap off ship decks and through ocean waves and, in one especially memorable case, from a mountaintop into a shimmering lagoon (which, for the literal-minded, means jumping off a ladder and into a silver fireman\u2019s net)."
,"Such kinetic intensity is of a piece with Mr. Barry and Mr. Pearson\u2019s original novel, a retrospective riff on J. M. Barrie\u2019s \"Peter Pan\" stories that would not seem prime material for the stage. Merging the affable, straight-faced whimsy of Dave Barry, the author and former humor columnist, with the plot-spinning skills of Mr. Pearson, a suspense novelist, the children\u2019s book is divided into short, fast, highly eventful chapters that might translate naturally into a fantasy action movie, preferably animated."
,"The stage script by Mr. Elice (\"Jersey Boys,\" \"The Addams Family\") condenses and simplifies the novel\u2019s multistranded plot while making more explicit reference to the Barrie prototype. It is also sillier and more sentimental, as the demands of showbiz warrant."
,"And don\u2019t think for a second that this production isn\u2019t showbiz at its most brazenly infectious. In telling a complicated story - it involves pirates, orphans and some transformative substance that comes from fallen stars - Mr. Rees and Mr. Timbers are endlessly and flamboyantly resourceful, transforming their cast into a single, multilimbed and remarkably efficient narrative organism."
,"Each director brings his own pertinent set of skills to the enterprise. Mr. Rees, you may recall, played the title character in the Royal Shakespeare Company\u2019s fabled marathon adaptation of Charles Dickens\u2019s \"Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby\" (seen on Broadway in 1981), which many theatergoers remember as the apotheosis of story theater. Like \"Nickleby,\" \"Starcatcher\" uses its cast members both to deliver a third-person narrative and to slip into different eccentric characters, who include salty sailors, helpful mermaids and a group of restless and possibly homicidal island natives."
,"Mr. Timbers is the hip theater director (if that\u2019s not an oxymoron) responsible for, among other productions, the inspired, genre-scrambling, historical bio-musical \"Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson.\" And \"Starcatcher,\" like \"Jackson,\" walks a slippery tightrope between flippancy and highly charged sincerity without losing its balance. It also revels in the kind of antic verbal humor - tongue twisters, bad puns, fleetingly tossed-off anachronisms - that classically appeals to the arrested goofball in grown-ups as well as to children."
,"On the page the script for \"Starcatcher\" verges on preciousness on the one hand and snarkiness on the other. But on the stage it acquires the excited, self-delighted giddiness you associate with really good yarn spinners."
,"Donyale Werle\u2019s dream box of a set is all sooty shadows in the first act and music-hall paradise sunshine in the second (with matching lighting by Jeff Croiter and witty, period-scrambling costumes by Paloma Young)."
,"Against this backdrop the performers keep reconfiguring themselves into various shapes that serve to evoke (quite ravishingly) the different cabins of a ship, a hungry and dynamic ocean and (with the use of foliage-shaped panels) a jungle to get lost in. (Steven Hoggett is credited with overseeing \"movement,\" which in this show means a lot.)"
,"The style of acting brings to mind the British fairy-tale Christmastime entertainments known as panto, early-20th-century vaudeville and the mildly naughty musical romps from the 1930s of Rodgers and Hart and Cole Porter. (Wayne Barker wrote the music, which includes a delicious Ziegfeld-Girl-style second-act opener for the saucy mermaids.)"
,"The cast is, with one exception, male, and, with no exceptions, wonderful. Celia Keenan-Bolger takes on the womanly duties as Molly, a brainy and resourceful 13-year-old, embodying a proto-feminist willpower with stylish wit and ardor. She provides the sort-of love interest for the nameless, homeless boy who discovers his identity (and a name for the ages) in the course of the show. He is played by Adam Chanler-Berat (the likable stoner in \"Next to Normal\" on Broadway) as an every-adolescent sort of brooder that pretty much anyone who is, was or plans to be a teenager will identify with."
,"But it\u2019s Christian Borle (late of \"Angels in America\") who perhaps best captures the show\u2019s knowing innocence and culture-mixing wizardry. Mr. Borle plays a pirate named Black Stache (who is poised to become that loathsome creature named Captain Hook) as a blend of Groucho Marx, Peter Allen and the ultimate Shakespearean ham."
,"It\u2019s a performance that you might classify as over the top, but only in the sense that the entire production is. With grown-up theatrical savvy and a child\u2019s wonder at what it can achieve, \"Peter and the Starcatcher\" floats right through the ceiling of the physical limits imposed by a three-dimensional stage. While there\u2019s not a body harness in sight, like those used to hoist the title characters of \"Mary Poppins\" and \"Spider-Man,\" this show never stops flying."

"Many human beings evidently share with the magpie a gene causing an irrational attraction to bright and shiny objects. If you suffer from this disorder, you will love \"Cloisonn\u00E9: Chinese Enamels From the Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties,\" a ravishing exhibition at the Bard Graduate Center."
,"Displaying more than 160 items ranging from pocket- to armchair-size, the exhibition, on three floors of a former town house, samples almost seven centuries\u2019 worth of domestic and ceremonial enamel ware. Bowls, vases, incense burners, jewelry boxes and garden stools made of copper alloys have surfaces covered with intricate mosaic patterns and imagery in pure blues, reds, yellows and greens. Many have additional gilded-metal ornamentation in the form of dragons, lions, bears and elephants."
,"The show, which comes with a richly informative, lavishly illustrated catalog, was organized by the Bard Graduate Center in collaboration with Mus\u00E9e des Arts Decoratifs in Paris. The curator is B\u00E9atrice Quette of the Mus\u00E9e des Arts Decoratifs."
,"The cloisonn\u00E9 process entails application of pastes made of ground colored glass into cells that are bounded by thin strips of metal standing on edge on flat or curved surfaces. Heated in a kiln, the paste melts into enamel; sanding and buffing results in glossy surfaces."
,"Unlike lacquer ware, whose traditionally black or cinnabar red hue has a sobering effect on its otherwise sumptuous designs, Chinese cloisonn\u00E9 - much of which was made for imperial court decoration - can have a gaudy opulence like that of French Rococo. The intoxicating sensual appeal may seem out of step with imperatives of Buddhist humility, but there is often a transcendentalist aspect in cloisonn\u00E9\u2019s metaphysical symbolism and its otherworldly beauty. A Qing dynasty plate with a ferocious, serpentine dragon flying toward the viewer with talismanic emblems gripped in its talons is like a hallucinatory emissary from the collective unconscious."
,"Cloisonn\u00E9 was not invented in China; it was a 13th- or 14th-century import from Byzantium. But Chinese craftsmen certainly made it their own. Its stylistic evolution is hard to track because of the Chinese penchant for recycling the past and because dating marks inscribed on metal bottoms, which could be added at any time, cannot be trusted. The general trend, however, was toward bigger, more complicated and luxurious creations."
,"Simpler early works, like a pair of Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) bottles with cylindrical necks and rotund bodies bearing lively floral patterns, were inspired by Han dynasty forms from more than 1,000 years before. Four centuries after those modest containers come pieces like the fabulous 3 &#189;-foot-tall Qing dynasty \"Grand Imperial Vase,\" whose five parts include a trumpet-shaped top with gold handles in the form of curvy, semi-abstract mythic creatures; a bulbous body profusely covered by fish and flowers on a turquoise background; and a base supported by three golden chimera."
,"There are remarkable exceptions to the polychrome rule. An exceedingly elegant example is an 18th-century ivory-white basin with a dense vine pattern drawn in copper alloy lines."
,"Some of the most enchanting works represent animals. A festive wine vessel from the 18th century has a vase supported on the back of a fanciful, rainbow-feathered bird whose breast rides on a pair of ornate wheels. It could be a pull toy for a wealthy child."
,"Degrees of realism vary widely. Based on a Han dynasty prototype, an 18th-century bottle with a neck ending in the head of a duck and a spherical body covered by hexagonal modules and red blossoms offers an archaic, semi-abstract simplicity. A seven-inch sculpture of a goose (possibly 17th century), on the other hand, is wonderfully naturalistic. Standing flat on golden, webbed feet, it turns its head to stare with goosey, goggle-eyed curiosity."
,"Certain works exert mystic electricity. A large Qing dynasty vase in the form of a flattened sphere known as a \"pilgrim flask\" has a mesmerizing mandala on either side. At the center is a small black-and-white yin-yang symbol. And eight traditional Buddhist \"auspicious symbols\" - including the Lotus, the Twin Fish and the Endless Knot - are incorporated into the black and red trellislike pattern on a blue ground radiating from the center. Meditate on this piece long enough and you might achieve Tantric liftoff."
,"Western interest in Chinese cloisonn\u00E9 blossomed after the second Opium War, which ended in 1860. (That conflict arose because the British had been smuggling opium in vast quantities from India to China, contrary to Chinese law.) Britain prevailed, and, in addition to forcing the Chinese to accept opium importing, liberalized trade with China generally. All kinds of Chinese antiquities found their way into the hands of Western scholars, collectors and museums. Duly impressed by cloisonn\u00E9 discoveries, some European artists designed their own Chinese-style cloisonn\u00E9s. Several examples are in the exhibition, including one by the French painter James Tissot."
,"Around 1870, Tissot acquired a gorgeous basin with pastoral and mountainous landscapes on its sides that was among many treasures looted from the Summer Palace in Beijing by British and French soldiers in 1860. That object is here displayed next to a Tissot design that it inspired. The pairing is instructive. Tissot substituted for the cute golden lion-shaped handles a pair of languorous, long-haired nude women seated on dragon heads. The cloisonn\u00E9 landscapes on his basin relate to those of the Chinese piece, but they are pedestrian by comparison. His work is suave but spiritually dull; the Chinese piece is pure magic."
,"\"Cloisonn\u00E9\" runs through April 17at Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan; (212) 501-3000, bgc.bard.edu."

"Rage and love, those consuming emotions felt with a particularly acute pang in youth, all but burn up the stage in \"American Idiot,\" the thrillingly raucous and gorgeously wrought Broadway musical adapted from the blockbuster pop-punk album by Green Day."
,"Pop on Broadway, sure. But punk? Yes, indeed, and served straight up, with each sneering lyric and snarling riff in place. A stately old pile steps from the tourist-clogged Times Square might seem a strange place for the music of Green Day, and for theater this blunt, bold and aggressive in its attitude. Not to mention loud. But from the moment the curtain rises on a panorama of baleful youngsters at the venerable St. James Theater, where the show opened on Tuesday night, it\u2019s clear that these kids are going to make themselves at home, even if it means tearing up the place in the process."
,"Which they do, figuratively speaking. \"American Idiot,\" directed by Michael Mayer and performed with galvanizing intensity by a terrific cast, detonates a fierce aesthetic charge in this ho-hum Broadway season. A pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions - bring on the sex, drugs and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, please! - only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I\u2019ve seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past."
,"Burning with rage and love, and knowing how and when to express them, are two different things, of course. The young men we meet in the first minutes of \"American Idiot\" are too callow and sullen and restless - too young, basically - to channel their emotions constructively. The show opens with a glorious 20-minute temper tantrum kicked off by the title song."
,"\"Don\u2019t want to be an American idiot!\" shouts one of the gang. The song\u2019s signature electric guitar riff slashes through the air, echoing the testy challenge of the cry. A sharp eight-piece band, led by the conductor Carmel Dean, is arrayed around the stage, providing a sonic frame for the action. The simple but spectacular set, designed by Christine Jones, suggests an epically scaled dive club, its looming walls papered in punk posters and pimpled by television screens, on which frenzied video collages flicker throughout the show. (They\u2019re the witty work of Darrel Maloney.)"
,"Who\u2019s the American idiot being referred to? Well, as that curtain slowly rose, we heard the familiar voice of George W. Bush break through a haze of television chatter: \"Either you are with us, or with the terrorists.\" That kind of talk could bring out the heedless rebel in any kid, particularly one who is already feeling itchy at the lack of prospects in his dreary suburban burg."
,"But while \"American Idiot\" is nominally a portrait of youthful malaise of a particular era - the album dates from 2004, the midpoint of the Bush years, and the show is set in \"the recent past\" - its depiction of the crisis of post-adolescence is essentially timeless. Teenagers eager for their lives to begin, desperate to slough off their old selves and escape boredom through pure sensation, will probably always be making the same kinds of mistakes, taking the same wrong turns on the road to self-discovery."
,"\"American Idiot\" is a true rock opera, almost exclusively using the music of Green Day and the lyrics of its kohl-eyed frontman, Billie Joe Armstrong, to tell its story. (The score comprises the whole of the title album as well as several songs from the band\u2019s most recent release, \"21st Century Breakdown.\") The book, by Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Mayer, consists only of a series of brief, snarky dispatches sent home by the central character, Johnny, played with squirmy intensity by the immensely gifted John Gallagher Jr. (\"Spring Awakening,\" \"Rabbit Hole\")."
,"\"I held up my local convenience store to get a bus ticket,\" Johnny says with a smirk as he and a pal head out of town."
,"\"Actually I stole the money from my mom\u2019s dresser.\""
,"Beat."
,"\"Actually she lent me the cash.\""
,"Such is the sheepish fate of a would-be rebel today. But at least Johnny and his buddy Tunny (Stark Sands) do manage to escape deadly suburbia for the lively city, bringing along just their guitars and the anomie and apathy that are the bread and butter of teenage attitudinizing the world over. (\"I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t care,\" a telling lyric, could be their motto.)"
,"The friend they meant to bring along, Will (Michael Esper), was forced to stay home when he discovered that his girlfriend (Mary Faber) was pregnant. Lost and lonely, and far from ready for the responsibilities of fatherhood, he sinks into the couch, beer in one hand and bong in the other, as his friends set off for adventure."
,"Beneath the swagger of indifference, of course, are anxiety, fear and insecurity, which Mr. Gallagher, Mr. Esper and Mr. Sands transmit with aching clarity in the show\u2019s more reflective songs, like the hit \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" or the lilting anthem \"Are We the Waiting.\" The city turns out to be just a bigger version of the place Johnny and Tunny left behind, a \"land of make believe that don\u2019t believe in me.\" The boys discover that while a fractious 21st-century America may not offer any easy paths to fulfillment, the deeper problem is that they don\u2019t know how to believe in themselves."
,"Johnny strolls the lonely streets with his guitar, vaguely yearning for love and achievement. He eventually hooks up with a girl (a vivid Rebecca Naomi Jones) but falls more powerfully under the spell of an androgynous goth drug pusher, St. Jimmy, played with mesmerizing vitality and piercing vocalism by Tony Vincent. Tunny mostly stays in bed, clicker affixed to his right hand, dangerously susceptible to a pageant of propaganda about military heroism on the tube, set to the song \"Favorite Son.\" By the time the song\u2019s over, he\u2019s enlisted and off to Iraq."
,"In both plotting and its emotional palette, \"American Idiot\" is drawn in brash, primary-colored strokes, maybe too crudely for those looking for specifics of character rather than cultural archetypes. But operas - rock or classical - often trade in archetypes, and the actors flesh out their characters\u2019 journeys through their heartfelt interpretations of the songs, with the help of Mr. Mayer\u2019s poetic direction and the restless, convulsive choreography of Steven Hoggett (\"Black Watch\"), which exults in both the grace and the awkwardness of energy-generating young metabolisms."
,"Line by line, a skeptic could fault Mr. Armstrong\u2019s lyrics for their occasional glibness or grandiosity. That\u2019s to be expected, too: rock music exploits heightened emotion and truisms that can fit neatly into a memorable chorus. The songs are precisely as articulate - and inarticulate - as the characters are, reflecting the moment in youth when many of us feel that pop music has more to say about us than we have to say for ourselves. (And, really, have you ever worked your way through a canonical Italian opera libretto, line by line?)"
,"In any case the music is thrilling: charged with urgency, rich in memorable melody and propulsive rhythms that sometimes evolve midsong. The orchestrations by Tom Kitt (the composer of \"Next to Normal\") move from lean and mean to lush, befitting the tone of each number. Even if you are unfamiliar with Green Day\u2019s music, you are more likely to emerge from this show humming one of the guitar riffs than you are to find a tune from \"The Addams Family\" tickling your memory."
,"But the emotion charge that the show generates is as memorable as the music. \"American Idiot\" jolts you right back to the dizzying roller coaster of young adulthood, that turbulent time when ecstasy and misery almost seem interchangeable states, flip sides of the coin of exaltation. It captures with a piercing intensity that moment in life when everything seems possible, and nothing seems worth doing, or maybe it\u2019s the other way around."

"The Museum of Modern Art doesn\u2019t mess around with its vaunted permanent collection and core narrative. It may sometimes festoon the atrium or exterior with video projections or set live performers loose in the temporary-exhibition galleries."
,"It may even declare a brief time out from linearity and big names and let the curators toss around masterpieces like salad, as it did with the \"Modern Starts\" exhibitions at the turn of this century. And it may rather fatuously pat itself on its back for turning the museum into a \"social space,\" as if art\u2019s osmotic, life-changing sociability weren\u2019t enough."
,"But when it comes to the past, the Modern stays the course as only the Modern can, which is magnificently, lavishly, intelligently, if also myopically. Its undeniably splendid landmark exhibition \"Abstract Expressionist New York: The Big Picture\" is a case in point."
,"This exhibition digs deep into the bedrock of the first American art style of international stature, formed by a hard-drinking, self-destructive band of mostly brothers who wrested a brave new style from European art, much of it set before them by - who else? - the Museum of Modern Art. The show brings all kinds of rich ore to the surface. And yet, and yet - it also sails into the future as if it were the past, and leaves you wondering if things might have been done a bit differently, with greater flexibility."
,"The exhibition is part generous show-and-tell and part velvet-gloved manifesto, which says, basically, this is the way we\u2019ve always done it and always will. To accommodate the installation, the Modern has cleared its fourth-floor permanent-exhibition galleries and put Ann Temkin, chief curator of the department of painting and sculpture, in charge. Ms. Temkin has orchestrated a spacious, often brilliant installation of nearly 100 paintings and some 60 sculptures, drawings, prints and photographs, along with related ephemera, much of which traces the museum\u2019s longstanding support of the style. Everything on view is from the Modern\u2019s collection; some of it hasn\u2019t been seen in decades."
,"It should be said that in mounting this show, Ms. Temkin had to work with the hand dealt her by generations of curatorial and trustee decisions and preferences. Especially blatant is the institutional bias against the great Willem de Kooning, represented here by a meager four paintings placed almost at random."
,"Even so, the show is more a generous retrenchment than an attempted revision. You could say that the nicely ambiguous title has been narrowly interpreted. This is not a survey of New York art in the Abstract Expressionist era; it generally features card-carrying, actively consorting Abstract Expressionists. It is not a bigger picture of the style than has previously been understood: it seems to be mostly about large canvases, spaciously installed in rhythms that, by show\u2019s end, start to feel a bit monotonous."
,"Still, in the face of the show\u2019s undeniable legerdemain, the logical first reaction is: what\u2019s not to like? Bandying about a few numbers and high points gives a sense of the scope. There is an especially immersive gallery devoted to eight radiantly colored canvases by Mark Rothko, and another nearly as intense, with seven by Barnett Newman, as well as generous pockets of paintings by Arshile Gorky, Adolph Gottlieb, Robert Motherwell, Franz Kline and Philip Guston, whose figurative 1969 \"Edge of Town,\" near the show\u2019s exit, designates him as the only artist who got out alive. Attention is given to artists like Bradley Walker Tomlin, Grace Hartigan, Alfred Leslie and Richard Pousette-Dart, whose names may be new to many younger visitors."
,"Above all, there are 18 works by Jackson Pollock, starting with his snarling \"She-Wolf,\" made in 1943 and acquired the next year. It is the first thing you\u2019ll see in the show\u2019s astounding opening gallery, where it announces the advent of the style, much the way Picasso\u2019s \"Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon\" does Cubism - with grating, protean aggressiveness."
,"Hours can be spent in this gallery alone, the show\u2019s best by far for the way it mixes things up. Basically it sets six early Pollocks against eight early efforts by Guston, Pousette-Dart, Rothko, Hans Hofmann, Theodoros Stamos and William Baziotes. The gallery is a pitched battle about painting versus drawing, figure-ground versus all-over composition; stained versus impastoed surfaces; mythic versus biomorphic forms; and who dripped first. Pollock chews up the scenery at every turn, never repeating himself, barely painting the same way twice in his pursuit of all-overness."
,"The valuable curatorial wisdom here is that artists often look better - sharper, fuller - in the company of their peers than in the regal isolation of museum retrospectives. And the peers more than hold up here. Paintings by Pousette-Dart from 1940 and 1943 give \"She-Wolf\" a run for its money. Rothko\u2019s evanescent \"Slow Swirl at the Edge of the Sea,\" with its delicate biomorphic forms twirling on seeping white, does a wonderful tango with the white-cake-icing impasto of Pollock\u2019s \"Shimmering Substance.\""
,"Some things you will see for the first time or as if for the first time."
,"I never quite noticed the penile positioning of the blue blob in Baziotes\u2019s otherwise bright green \"Dwarf,\" a semi-abstract gnome that the Modern acquired in 1947 and that makes a hilarious comment on male posturing, of which the Abstract Expressionist painters knew a thing or two. Nor has Pollock\u2019s tiny 1941 \"Mask\" ever struck me so forcefully as an all-in-one response to 1930s Picasso; it compresses Picasso\u2019s minotaur, screaming horses and blush-cheeked Marie-Th\u00E9r\u00E8se into a single bristling head surrounded by basket-weave brushstrokes and starry orbs."
,"Later on, the staggered yellows, oranges and chartreuses of Rothko\u2019s ebullient \"No. 1 (Untitled)\" from 1948 confirm how magnificent transitional works can be. It looks back to the abbreviated landscapes of Milton Avery, Rothko\u2019s mentor, and forward to the freer stains of Helen Frankenthaler while also plotting Rothko\u2019s own maturity."
,"Lee Krasner\u2019s 1951 painting \"Number 3 (Untitled)\" is a wonderfully refreshing sight, although it made me wish Ms. Temkin had not limited her sculptural selection to five works by David Smith and one smoldering black-on-black relief by Louise Nevelson. The Krasner\u2019s woody gray and rose verticals almost cry out for the company of some of Louise Bourgeois\u2019s totemic sculptures from the early 1950s, which may be the most innovatively abstract and expressionist of postwar American sculptures."
,"To see a Bourgeois sculpture requires visiting two smaller related exhibitions on the second and third floors that accompany Ms. Temkin\u2019s. Offering a change of pace with cheek-by-jowl installations of smaller works, they have been organized by Jodi Hauptmann, curator of drawings, and Sarah Suzuki, assistant curator of prints and illustrated books. \"Ab Ex New York: Ideas Not Theories\" delves into the goings-on at the legendary Eighth Street forum, the Club. \"Ab Ex New York: Rock Paper Scissors\" juxtaposes drawings, prints and objects by a dozen or so sculptors, including Bourgeois, Nevelson and also David Hare, Herbert Ferber, Isamu Noguchi and Richard Lippold. (For the record, the museum\u2019s official adoption of the contraction of Ab Ex for Abstract Expressionism is a little like the proverbial watching of the parents smoking marijuana, even in the age of texting.)"
,"There are some wonderful moments in these displays: engrossing works on paper galore; a quintet of wire sculptures by Lippold; the muscular wood and rope sculpture, \"Totem for All Religions,\" by Frederick Kiesler; and a 1943 rug of biomorphic design by the painter John Ferren. Its imagery seems right in step with the early Baziotes and Rothko in the first gallery upstairs, as does a striking mosaic, also from 1943, by the painter Jeanne Reynal."
,"But despite a greater number of unfamiliar names and works, these shows still reinforce the sense of historical correctness that prevails in the big one upstairs."
,"In the end Ms. Temkin\u2019s remarkable effort and its flanking shows display in different ways a reluctance to question the linear unspooling of art history according to designated styles that remains the Modern\u2019s core value and its Achilles\u2019 heel. (There have always been entrance requirements; the only difference is that those of the moment dictate a Conceptual-political pedigree.)"
,"You can see that Ms. Temkin had moments of leaning toward greater flexibility. The book accompanying the exhibition reproduces several impressive paintings by underexposed artists that would have made the proceedings feel more surprising and fuzzy around the edges. These include paintings by Romare Bearden, George McNeil, Milton Resnick and a work by Norman Lewis that is more interesting than either of the ones by him in the galleries. Perhaps there could also have been two, rather than one painting each, by Joan Mitchell or Ms. Frankenthaler, and one or two fewer works by Kline, Ad Reinhardt or Gottlieb."
,"One omission underscores this point: Janet Sobel, a self-taught artist who made and exhibited small drip paintings in New York in the mid-1940s while also working in a peasant-art-flavored figurative style. It is possible that Pollock saw these paintings, of which the Modern own three examples. But does it really matter? These works were a part of Abstract Expressionist New York. They picked up on ideas in the air. If they\u2019re good enough to be in the Modern\u2019s collection, they should be here."
,"Alfred H. Barr Jr., the Modern\u2019s visionary founding director, drew a well-known outline of Modern art movements and famously likened the museum\u2019s collection to a torpedo moving through time. The implication was that the collection\u2019s involvement with the present is broad, but its back end is increasingly narrow, as superfluous, minor art falls away. But art is not so amenable to outlining, and art movements are really messy, edgeless things that should only become more so with age. Maybe it is time for a new, less militant metaphor. One possibility is a perpetually expanding umbrella, where everything - a historical moment, a museum\u2019s reach and our consciousness - only increases."

"When China\u2019s last emperor finally left the premises in 1924, the Forbidden City was renamed the Palace Museum, and a labyrinthine complex of ceremonial and domestic spaces, off limits to all but a few for centuries, was suddenly open to the world."
,"Still, it kept some secrets. Few visitors, for example, knew of the existence of a self-contained suite of small pavilions and gardens tucked away at the Forbidden City\u2019s northeast corner, echoing its shape."
,"They made up the Tranquillity and Longevity Palace, which, in the mid-18th century, had been remodeled as a potential retirement home by the adamantly unretiring and design-obsessed Qing dynasty emperor Qianlong."
,"He lavished attention on the palace - covered its walls with trompe l\u2019oeil paintings, fitted it out with false doors, see-through partitions, Buddhist shrines and clocks - to make it a place that reflected his adventurous tastes, a place where he might want to live. But in the end, he spent little time there. And the palace, often referred to now as the Qianlong Garden, had only a handful of imperial tenants after he died in 1799."
,"For most of the 20th century it stayed empty. The Chinese government had no cash to spare for its upkeep, and conserving Qing culture was on no one\u2019s list of priorities. The building exteriors were maintained, but the interiors, with their frozen-in-time ensembles of furniture, painting, textiles and luxury objects, were left to fend for themselves."
,"Things have changed. China, now (and not for the first time) a global power in need of an agreeable self-image to sell, has seen the wisdom of preserving its visual heritage - all of it. And international scholars of that heritage, once separated by distance, are now thoroughly networked. A concrete result of this new one-worldism is a collaboration, now in progress, between the Palace Museum and the World Monuments Fund to restore the Qianlong Garden to its former splendor."
,"Among the art historians acting as consultants to the project is Nancy Berliner, the curator of Chinese art at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Mass. By 2003, the year the restoration got under way, Ms. Berliner had already scored a Qing-related coup of her own by overseeing the transfer, from China to the Salem museum, of an intact house dating to the dynasty. And last fall she scored a second one with \"The Emperor\u2019s Private Paradise: Treasures From the Forbidden City,\" an exhibition she organized for the Peabody Essex, and which now appears, in a different form, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art."
,"The show is made up primarily of freshly conserved Qing objects - thrones, cabinets, screens, religious sculptures, paintings - from the collection of the Palace Museum, many specifically from Qianlong Garden buildings. Qianlong himself probably commissioned some of the items. Certainly his sensibility is written all over them."
,"Born in Beijing in 1711, Qianlong (pronounced Chee-en lohng) descended from non-Chinese-speaking northerners who called themselves Manchu and ruled China as the Qing dynasty from 1644 to 1911. Self-confident and adventurous, he was a ceaseless mover and doer, constantly making inspection tours of a country that during his reign was the largest and richest in the world."
,"Largeness, in fact, was his calling card. His cultural initiatives seem conceived precisely to generate preposterous statistics. He commissioned and participated in the creation of an anthology of 2,000 years of Chinese literature: it appeared in the form of 36,000 handwritten volumes, which he ordered to be copied several times."
,"A writer himself, he left more than 40,000 poems behind when he died. When he was 50, he published a compendium of his calligraphy. He acquired art of all kinds in record-breaking quantities. At one point he cataloged a collection of some 10,000 of his paintings, then went on to collect more."
,"He was a knot of contradictions. He preserved thousand of books in his anthology, but also destroyed thousands, some of them legendary classics, that he considered politically subversive. As an art connoisseur, he had an uncannily sensitive eye, yet he insisted on incising his name into precious ceramics and writing it repeatedly on priceless paintings, effectively defacing them."
,"Although he had many self-portraits made, no cohesive reading of his personality can be drawn from them. In one painting he is an imposing Confucian ancestor figure; in another, a humble young Daoist scholar. In a third piece we find him floating at the center of a Tibetan Buddhist mandala as the embodiment of the bodhisattva of wisdom, which he believed himself to be."
,"As a highly self-aware performer, he exploited the public relations uses of shape-shifting, offering alternate versions of himself to different audiences, Manchu, Han Chinese and European."
,"He was wary of Europe politically, but entranced by vision-tickling aspects of its art, like vanishing-point perspective and trompe l\u2019oeil realism. Christianity left him cold - why should he worship a supreme being when he was one? - but he treasured Jesuit missionary artists like Giuseppe Castiglione and kept them on his payroll."
,"Contradiction is also the animating dynamic of the art in the Met show created to adorn the various buildings - reception halls, studios, libraries, Buddhist shrines - in the Qianlong Garden."
,"In the circular portrait of the young Qianlong in scholar robes in the first gallery, the pictorial space is pancake-flat, depthless. But in a Western-style mural painting on silk nearby, life-size figures of woman and child beckon us into a three-dimensional hall. (Several such murals cover walls in the one Qianlong Garden building that was fully restored in 2008 and can be digitally toured in another Met gallery.)"
,"Realism in Qing art, however, often veers into the surreal, as is evident in a mesmerizingly bizarre furniture ensemble. Like some version of rustic Victoriana, all three units - chair, couch bed, foot stool - appear to be woven from roots and vines, though in this case the interwoven strands look freakishly alive, writhing and twisting like nests of snakes. Only when you inspect the furniture closely do you see that this organicism run riot is strictly an illusion. The roots and vines have been painstakingly puzzled together from many small pieces of wood, in a design meant to evoke a Daoist immersion in nature."
,"This kind of interplay between opposites - the unnatural and the natural, the grotesque and the spiritual - powers the show. Qianlong went for art and design that pushed such contrasts to the limit and beyond, short-circuiting received notions of good taste and bad taste to deliver little shocks of pleasure."
,"You can feel such zaps radiating from one work in particular: a 16-panel wood-and-lacquer screen carrying portraits of early disciples of the Buddha, known as luohans. These figures are traditionally pretty gross: ragged and repellent old men, with cartoon faces and hair sprouting from unlikely places. They\u2019re shown that way here too, but in a medium - white jade inlaid on black lacquer - that is so ethereal, and worked with such fineness, as to all but cancel out any impression of ugliness."
,"The screen holds another surprise too. When conservators moved it from its original position against a wall, they found that the reverse sides of the panels were painted with images of trees and flowers in tones of gold. Stunning!"
,"At the Peabody Essex, the screen was free-standing and could be viewed from both sides. The Met, by contrast, has placed it in a long wall case, with the luohans face out, and a few panels flipped to give a sampling of the painting. And this is just one of the ways in which the Met edition of the show differs from the Salem original."
,"Judging from photographs, you can see that the installation Ms. Berliner devised at the Peabody Essex was spaciously laid out, with an effort made to simulate the architectural interior in which the objects were once found. At the Met, the same objects have been squeezed into the narrow Chinese painting galleries, with almost everything confined to tall cases designed to hold scrolls."
,"As if to compensate for a more straightened and prosaic approach, the New York presentation - organized by Maxwell K. Hearn, curator of Chinese art, with an ingenious design by Daniel Kershaw - has been enriched with examples of Qing art from the Met\u2019s collection, including a large Castiglione drawing and a pair of panoramic scrolls depicting two of Qianlong\u2019s imperial road trips."
,"We also get something that in most museums we can only imagine: a real garden, in the form of the Astor Court. It\u2019s based on a Ming rather than a Qing prototype, but the components - twisty river rocks set in greenery - are right. And, because the Met\u2019s display cases are as shallow as they are tall, we can see everything in them close-up: the cloisonn\u00E9 medallions adorning a doorway surround, the stitch work in a satin chair cover, the chips of jade, coral and lapis lazuli embedded in a relief of a blossoming plum tree that comes across as both garish and sumptuous."
,"Up close was the emperor\u2019s perspective too: proprietary, absorbed, evaluative. And - who knows? - it may not be available again, once these objects return to Beijing and are placed, where they belong, in the completely restored Qianlong Garden that is scheduled to reopen in 2019, to what will surely be an avid new public."

"Sometimes a kitchen is just a kitchen, but not often. If a house is a machine for living, as Le Corbusier said, then the kitchen is its engine. If that machine is seen as a living organism - a house that is a home - then the kitchen is its heart and brain."
,"The many-splendored thing that is the modern kitchen - as a coherent workspace, object of study and model of efficiency - began to take shape sometime around 1900. It has been a leading indicator of the state of design ever since. It has also been a battlefield of conflicting belief systems, not least regarding the role of women in society. As the use of servants declined, housewives became at once early adopters of new products meant to free them from drudgery and targets of corporate advertising that relentlessly defined them as household fixtures themselves."
,"Which is to say, kitchens were heavily symbolic sites long before any of us became involved with the ones that bless or blight our individual lives. This is elaborately demonstrated by \"Counter Space: Design and the Modern Kitchen\" at the Museum of Modern Art."
,"Using a tantalizing sprawl of design objects, artifacts and artworks, this exhibition places the modern kitchen in a broad historical context. It is bound to invite personal memories: I rediscovered the Ekco vegetable peeler, Chemex coffeemaker and copper-bottomed Revere Ware saucepan of my mother\u2019s kitchen; the Terraillon plastic food scale and timer from my first New York apartment; and the old domed Magnalite tea kettle that an ex-boyfriend cherished."
,"But in the main, \"Counter Space\" sprints with dazzling speed and pinpoint precision across an amazing amount of social and aesthetic history, and shows how these histories are connected. The kitchen\u2019s design evolution meshed with the new availability of gas and electricity; with the rise of cities, the middle class and health consciousness; with early stabs at prefab housing; with the growing independence of women; and of course with the emergence of modern design itself, as a self-consciously forward-looking, socially minded discipline whose brief was to improve everyday life for all."
,"Two world wars fed innovation by making efficiency and conservation pressing matters, creating food and housing shortages and luring women into the work force. As cities grew, the kitchen\u2019s need for regular infusions of fresh foodstuffs, heating and cooling energy, and waste disposal connected it to urban networks that were themselves still taking shape. The kitchen was something like Rome, with nearly all a city\u2019s infrastructure leading to it or away from it."
,"\"Counter Space\" confirms that few museums can muster a show of this kind as effectively as the Modern. It been assembled by Juliet Kinchin, curator in the department of architecture and design, and Aidan O\u2019Connor, a curatorial assistant, who have drawn entirely from the museum\u2019s collections. In addition to some 300 design objects clustered according to era, material or designer, it includes posters, paintings, films and film stills, prints and photographs - something from every department."
,"The museum\u2019s vision of and faith in modernism are a major subtext. MoMA\u2019s historic determination to encompass all that is emblematic of modern life is so breathtaking as to be almost self-congratulatory. \"See?\" the museum seems to say. \"We have this, that and the other, and they\u2019re all relevant and they all fit together in this story.\""
,"But the Modern has the goods. Peter Behren\u2019s 1909 electric tea kettle is here, nickel-plated to resemble parlor-worthy silver, along with a poster he designed two years earlier encouraging the use of electricity. An American poster from 1917 encourages Americans to eat less meat and fat, more grains and vegetables, not for their health, but to save food for Allied troops."
,"The objects range chronologically from the brown paper bag that Charles Stillwell designed for the Union Paper Bag Machine Company of Philadelphia in 1883 through a Levittown kitchen\u2019s worth of pastel-colored Tupperware from the mid-1950s to Philippe Starck\u2019s overly sculptural Juicy Salif Lemon Squeezer of 1988 (a countertop Louise Bourgeois spider) and Smart Design\u2019s far more user-friendly Good Grips peeler of 1989."
,"The show\u2019s centerpiece is a stupendous recent acquisition: one of the last surviving examples of a relatively complete Frankfurt Kitchen designed in 1926-27 by Margarete Sch&#252;tte-Lihotzky (1897-2000), Austria\u2019s first female architect. It was mass produced for housing blocks built in Frankfurt to meet housing shortages caused by the devastation of World War I, and remains a model of cockpitlike clarity and purpose. Including a grid of small metal bins (for storing rice and the like) that resembles a hardware store, it was one of several determinedly modern kitchens designed mostly in Germany in the late 1920s. But it is probably alone in being the subject of a recent music video tribute by the Austrian musician Robert Rotifer, which is also in the show."
,"\"Counter Space\" proceeds in three sections. \"The New Kitchen\" centers on design up through World War II, when the kitchen was conceived of as a kind of no-nonsense laboratory. Form follows function here, as do metal and glass and a tensile sense of geometry. The mid-1930s brought such classics as Wilhelm Wagenfeld\u2019s Kubus stacking storage containers, made of textured glass; Sherman Kelly\u2019s cast aluminum ice-cream scoop, upon which Brancusi could not have improved; and a handy-looking one-shot cake cutter by an unknown designer that could be a Duchamp readymade. Also here are posters from wartime Britain: those by Frederick H. K. Henrion expound on the economies of raising rabbits for food; several more by Herbert Tomlinson single out the destructiveness of mice."
,"\"Visions of Plenty,\" the second section, covers the explosion of new materials, especially colorful plastics, and expanding markets and growing residential footprints that followed the war, when one German designer presciently noted that \"America has fat kitchens, Europe has thin ones.\" In 1968, when the Italian designer Virgilio Forchiassin designed a mobile kitchen unit that folded up into something like a Minimalist cube, American kitchens were in the process of absorbing dining rooms, living rooms and the den."
,"Clever forms and pretty colors often superseded function. I, for one, can\u2019t imagine putting anything but decorative pieces of fruit in the bright transparent plastic serving dishes that Kenneth Brozen designed in 1963. But this was also the heyday of Braun\u2019s svelte appliances that made plastic seem as refined as porcelain, and signaled a Germany design resurgence; Kaj Franck\u2019s handsomely basic Kilta tableware for Arabia; and works of genius like the wasp-waisted Kikkoman soy sauce dispenser designed by the renowned Kenji Ekuan in 1961."
,"The final section, \"Kitchen Sink Dramas,\" centers on the kitchen as grist for the artistic mill starting with Pop Art - Andy Warhol\u2019s Brillo boxes, paintings by James Rosenquist and Tom Wesselmann - and continuing nearly to the present. In a way it is too bad not to devote all the gallery space to design itself, especially since some objects are displayed on high shelves and are difficult to see. But the tradeoff is a sharpened sense of the organic relationship between art and its social context."
,"An especially vivid example of this relationship is provided by the veritable mother lode of short promotional films and television commercials from the Modern\u2019s holdings in which the presumption of female docility and devotion could not be clearer. Titles like \"The Home Electric,\" a 1915 silent, and \"A Word to the Wives,\" from 1955, barely require description. Along with other clips, they supply visual evidence of the stereotypes that artists like Martha Rosler, Cindy Sherman and Laurie Simmons began to dismantle in the 1970s as the women\u2019s movement got underway. Their works are seen in the show\u2019s final section."
,"The connection is of course boilerplate art history, but to see it made with real-life art and artifacts against the rich backdrop of this exhibition is something else. Art may not be the best revenge, but it certainly helps."
,"\"Counter Space: Design and the Modern Kitchen\" continues through March 14 at the Museum of Modern Art; (212) 708-9400, moma.org."

"\"C\u00E9zanne\u2019s Card Players,\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, sounds like a show for our high-stakes moment. But the real appeal of this mini-blockbuster is its modest vision of a rural pastime, rendered with infinite patience. The big players who dominate the art world today would have a hard time identifying with C\u00E9zanne\u2019s peasants and laborers: men quietly passing the time, happy enough with the hand that life has dealt them."
,"With his series of \"Card Players,\" C\u00E9zanne reclaimed - and transformed - an activity from 17th-century genre painting. He dispensed with the sermonizing implicit in most earlier images of card playing, replacing sloppy-drunk gamblers with sober, stone-faced tradesmen. Yet he stopped short of portraiture, keeping his subjects - who were also his employees - at a socially appropriate distance."
,"\"Today everything is changing, but not for me,\" C\u00E9zanne said. \"I live in my hometown, and I rediscover the past in the faces of people my age.\" He found at least two such faces close at hand, on his family\u2019s estate outside Aix-en-Provence: those of the gardener Paulin Paulet and the farm worker P\u00E8re Alexandre."
,"At the Met these rugged characters appear again and again in the paintings and in numerous individual figure studies. Yet we never really get to know them; they remain \"types,\" as defined by their leisure activities -card playing, smoking - as they are by their m\u00E9tiers, their work."
,"In that sense the \"Card Players,\" which all date from the 1890s, romanticize agrarian Proven&#231;al culture and reaffirm centuries-old French social hierarchies. They\u2019re the product of an isolated man in his 50s, living and working on his family estate hundreds of miles away from an uproarious Paris. But it\u2019s impossible to ignore the paintings\u2019 overtures to Modernism: their patchy surfaces, compressed spaces and figurative liberties, which have moved L\u00E9ger and Jeff Wall, among others, to pay tribute."
,"\"C\u00E9zanne\u2019s Card Players\" was organized by the Met in conjunction with the Courtauld Gallery in London, where it appeared last fall. The Met\u2019s version of the show has fewer major works, even without accounting for the absence of \"The Smoker,\" from the Hermitage in St. Petersburg; a recent legal dispute has prevented that painting from traveling to the United States. Two important versions of the \"Card Players\"- the Barnes Foundation\u2019s large one, which never travels, and a smaller canvas from a private collection - are here only in reproduction. But the Met\u2019s incomplete deck is still deeply engrossing."
,"The Met curator Gary Tinterow has fleshed out the show with a small gallery of works from the museum\u2019s collection that typify the card-playing and smoking genres. These include 17th-century Dutch and Flemish etchings of jolly taverngoers, politically incisive 19th-century cartoons by Daumier, and Manet\u2019s print of a philosophical-looking smoker."
,"The players in most of these works are prone to greed, lust or acts of violence - sometimes all three. An etching after Caravaggio\u2019s \"Cardsharps\" carries an inscription from Horace: \"That game indeed gives rise to restless strife and anger.\""
,"C\u00E9zanne had clearly studied images like this one; he called his \"Card Players\" \"souvenirs of the museums.\" But he managed to separate the motif from its attendant morality."
,"Wine? In C\u00E9zanne\u2019s paintings there\u2019s sometimes a bottle on the table, but no glasses. Women? Not a one. And gambling? We don\u2019t see any money changing hands. Nor do we have any sense of who\u2019s winning or losing."
,"Much wall text is devoted to the curatorial parlor game of sequencing the paintings in the series; new research indicates that C\u00E9zanne worked on the four- and five-figure groupings first, then moved on to the two-player compositions."
,"More intriguing, to the nonexpert, is C\u00E9zanne\u2019s way of shuffling the cards: making individual studies and then assembling them on canvas, in various permutations. This explains the curious lack of interaction between the players - \"a kind of collective solitaire,\" in the words of the critic Meyer Schapiro."
,"The alienation is most pronounced in the Barnes painting, but it\u2019s apparent enough in the Met\u2019s version. The table seems hardly big enough to accommodate the three broad-shouldered men, yet each is absorbed in his hand. A fourth, standing, waits his turn."
,"The mood is more intense, and the dynamic a bit less stable, in the two-player groupings on the opposite wall. (One hails from the Mus\u00E9e d\u2019Orsay, the other from the Courtauld.) The peasants, seated on opposite sides of a table, mirror each other\u2019s gestures; a wine bottle divides the scene neatly in half. But the scene, though exquisitely balanced, isn\u2019t symmetrical; the table is slightly askew, and you can tell from the men\u2019s shoulders - one pair thin and rounded, the other broad and square - that they would not be well matched in a fight."
,"The angular physique belongs to the gardener, Paulet, recognizable from several studies. The other man, with the pipe and the more Gallic profile, also appears on paper but hasn\u2019t been conclusively identified. Both, along with P\u00E8re Alexandre, return in a final and phenomenal gallery of single-figure paintings."
,"Here smoking, not card playing, is the main activity. You can almost smell the tobacco in \"Man With a Pipe,\" with its proto-Giacometti, nicotine-stained palette, and \"The Smoker\" (from the Kunsthalle Mannheim, the only one of three \"Smokers\" to have made the trip). Looking at the able-bodied yet vacant-eyed figure of Paulet, in the riveting \"Smoker,\" you sense that C\u00E9zanne needed his subjects to be as absorbed in their leisure as he was in his work."
,"It\u2019s strange, then, that the young peasant in another standout painting - from a private collection - isn\u2019t smoking or playing cards or doing anything at all. His eyes are downcast but expressive, shaded with anxiety or exhaustion. Here C\u00E9zanne comes close to portraiture. Otherwise, he is a master of the poker face."

"The Beijing artist Wang Qingsong, born at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, has seen China morph from an insular, rural society to a globally engaged dynamo. His art has evolved just as rapidly, from Gaudy Painting (a Chinese variation on Pop) to giant photographs staged in movie studios and short, performance-based videos. All of these works regard recent changes in Chinese culture - the proliferation of McDonald\u2019s, overcrowded cities, even a booming art scene - from an ironic stance that needs no translation."
,"In the 2004 photograph \"Competition,\" for instance, he stands on a ladder with megaphone in hand in front of a wall of hand-lettered advertisements, giving a Western-inflected, consumerist twist to the old Red Guard posters that adorned city walls during the Cultural Revolution. Brand names including Citibank, Starbucks and Art Basel are visible, though much of the writing is in Chinese."
,"That striking image is part of a small survey, \"Wang Qingsong: When Worlds Collide,\" at the International Center of Photography. It\u2019s not the first appearance at the center for Mr. Wang (whose full name is pronounced wahng ching-SAHNG); he appeared in the 2004 exhibition \"Between Past and Future: New Photography and Video From China,\" organized jointly with Asia Society."
,"The current show is Mr. Wang\u2019s biggest presentation in the United States so far, though at just a dozen photographs and three videos it\u2019s a bit of a tease. It leaves you wanting to see more from this gimlet-eyed artist - and from the Center of Photography."
,"The curator Christopher Phillips, who organized the show, links Mr. Wang to Western photographers and painters like Gregory Crewdson and the Weimar-era satirist George Grosz. Other Westerners that may come to mind are Andreas Gursky, for his hyper-detailed depictions of unchecked globalism, and Thomas Demand, whose photographs of meticulously constructed paper-and-cardboard environments make fictions of \"real\" political events."
,"But it seems disingenuous to talk about the staged photograph, in this context, without acknowledging its Socialist Realist history. Government censorship is another subject left untouched in the show, even as the art world digests news about the destruction of the artist Ai Weiwei\u2019s studio in Shanghai this month. (Mr. Wang, though less outspoken than Mr. Ai, has in the past been questioned by the police and has had negatives confiscated.)"
,"The earliest works on view date from the late 1990s, after Mr. Wang abandoned his Gaudy Art paintings. They\u2019re sharply observant but not very nuanced; the image of a materialist Buddha clutching cigarettes, beer and a cellphone is typical."
,"The humor is more sophisticated in Mr. Wang\u2019s interpretation of the 10th-century scroll painting \"Night Revels of Han Xizai.\" He casts the Beijing art critic Li Xianting in the role of the debauched court official Han Xizai, and himself as the emperor\u2019s spy. Scantily clad \"courtesans\" sip Pepsi and Jack Daniel\u2019s as Mr. Wang peeks out from behind a curtain. Beyond the voyeurism there is a parable about the fate of the intellectual in contemporary China."
,"Almost as rich are the works from 2003-5, \"Competition\" among them, elaborately staged in a Beijing film studio and starring Mr. Wang. The sets are artworks in themselves, as is made clear by short behind-the-scenes videos at the photography center."
,"In \"Follow Me\" Mr. Wang sits at a desk in front of an enormous chalkboard covered in English and Chinese writing. The setup riffs on a popular BBC-Central China Television language-instruction program from the 1980s, but the words and phrases being taught here seem to have more to do with the millennial art boom; they include \"Documenta,\" \"Venice Biennale\" and \"Uli Sigg,\" the major Chinese-contemporary collector."
,"Other works offer wry commentary on the fast-tracked development of Chinese cities and the plight of the migrant workers who come from rural areas to build them. In the most recent of these images, \"Dormitory\" (2005), dozens of nude figures inhabit small compartments in what is essentially a giant bunk bed constructed by Mr. Wang. Curiously, some of them seem to be occupied by artist models (note the seated figure plucked from Man Ray\u2019s \"Ingres Violin,\" one of many Western art references in Mr. Wang\u2019s photographs)."
,"Just as he shifted from painting to photography Mr. Wang has lately turned to video, making short works that, in a familiar YouTube idiom, compress lengthy or difficult endeavors into just a couple of minutes. Some of them pick up on the urban themes in the photographs; for \"Skyscraper\" Mr. Wang hired construction workers to erect a 115-foot golden scaffold on the outskirts of Beijing."
,"Others, though, are more performance oriented. In \"Iron Man,\" for instance, the artist is pummeled bloody by spectral fists. The work\u2019s title, in Chinese, describes positive attributes of ambition and endurance. Westerners, though, are likely to perceive the violence as a dark meditation on human-rights abuses - notwithstanding Mr. Wang\u2019s broad grin at the end of the video, or his vague comments on the wall label. \"We all get hit in one form or another in life,\" he says, \"perhaps not literally but figuratively.\""
,"Violence also dominates \"123456 Chops,\" in which Mr. Wang\u2019s younger brother hacks a goat carcass into minuscule pieces on a wooden platform. It\u2019s a spectacularly grisly version of process art."
,"If the videos are any indication, Mr. Wang is moving from critiques of materialism to more subversive topics and from Hollywood-style set design to stripped-down, body-centric actions. His art is getting tougher as it gets lighter."
,"\"Wang Qingsong: When Worlds Collide\" continues through May 8 at the International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street; (212) 857-0000; icp.org."

"Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking you understand Margaret Walsh from the get-go, because she\u2019s not an easy gal to get a fix on. Not at first, anyway."
,"Embodied with an ideal balance of expertise and empathy by Frances McDormand, Margie (as her friends call her, using a hard \"g\") is the not-quite heroine of David Lindsay-Abaire\u2019s \"Good People,\" the very fine new play that opened Thursday night at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater. And discovering how Margie operates - and where she\u2019s coming from - is one of the more subtly surprising treats of this theater season."
,"Where Margie comes from is, on one level, a no-brainer. She\u2019s from South Boston, or Southie, and her most basic notions of herself are tied up in her identification with that neighborhood. She was born there, and the odds are she\u2019ll die there, never having escaped its particular culture of poverty and loyalty. Why this has to be is the gentle mystery that propels \"Good People,\" a Manhattan Theater Club production that also stars Tate Donovan and is directed with a skillfully slow hand by Daniel Sullivan. Other people escape from Southie, including a guy Margie dated in high school. Why can\u2019t she?"
,"For whatever reasons, the seedier milieus of Boston have of late become favorite haunts for popular crime novelists and filmmakers like Dennis Lehane (\"Mystic River\") and Ben Affleck (\"The Town\"), a fashionable place to uncover dark secrets on mean streets. Steeped in mouthy Southie lingo and hard-knocks sociology, \"Good People\" has a few secrets of its own, but their revelations are unlikely to startle you. In this play character really is fate. And when you look back, everyone has behaved exactly in character, without any plot-bending, credibility-stretching manipulations on the part of its author."
,"Such integrity is less common than you might think in theater. How often do you leave a play thinking, \"There\u2019s no way she would have done that,\" or \"He wouldn\u2019t talk like that\"? But as in his previous Broadway drama, the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Rabbit Hole\" (2006), Mr. Lindsay-Abaire (who grew up in South Boston) is scrupulous here about presenting people who are consistent even in their inconsistencies."
,"You get the feeling that this writer - who made his name with fantasy-tinged, diabolically whimsical works like \"Fuddy Meers\" and \"Kimberly Akimbo\" - feels a special obligation not to cheat or take shortcuts when working in naturalism. This means not only that \"Good People\" refuses to shy from the clich\u00E9s that its characters would normally use, but also that there is little that\u2019s dramatically flashy or high impact."
,"True, Margie has been given a couple of winningly foul-mouthed, bingo-playing eccentric cronies (deliciously portrayed by Estelle Parsons and Becky Ann Baker). But the production -- designed with unobtrusively heightened, class-defining detail by John Lee Beatty (sets) and David Zinn (costumes) - is achingly aware that what doesn\u2019t happen in people\u2019s lives counts for as much, if not more, than what does."
,"There\u2019s not a moment when Ms. McDormand is onstage that you don\u2019t feel Margie is assessing the absences in her existence as a single, working mother of a grown-up daughter with a child\u2019s mind. This is particularly true once she makes contact with Mike Dillon (Mr. Donovan, excellent), a guy she dated toward the end of high school (but hasn\u2019t seen in 30 years), who is now a successful fertility doctor."
,"Margie\u2019s reason for looking up Mike is an all-too familiar one in the current economy. She needs a job. In the play\u2019s first scene - which lays the groundwork for everything that follows in ways you don\u2019t fully appreciate at the time - Margie is fired by her boss, Stevie (Patrick Carroll), for excessive tardiness."
,"Margie knew Stevie when he was a boy, she knew his mother; she knows whom he\u2019s dating now and what people say about him behind his back. She is not above using this knowledge, easily accumulated and stored up in an insular neighborhood like Southie, for emotional blackmail. The thing about Margie, though, is that while she starts off tough, she\u2019s not so good on follow-through. And there comes a very specific moment - it happens when Ms. McDormand bends her knees just a bit, as if the breath has gone out of her - that you realize that not only is Margie conceding defeat here but also that she always knew she was going to."
,"This central paradox in Margie\u2019s character - what might be described as a feisty defeatism - is beautifully conveyed by Ms. McDormand, who won an Oscar for playing a far more assured figure, a tenacious Minnesota police officer in the 1996 film \"Fargo.\" In dealing with others, Margie is combative, sly, nasty and tricky. But in the very same breath she is doubtful, reluctant and self-sabotagingly kind."
,"This combination of elements leads Mike to describe Margie as a master of passive aggression when she shows up, uninvited, at his blandly expensive-looking office."
,"Certainly Margie knows what buttons to push (including by using the term \"lace-curtain Irish\") to trigger waves of guilt in her ex-boyfriend, who has lost nearly all contact with the old neighborhood. She wrangles an invitation to a party at Mike\u2019s home that weekend, given by his wife, Kate (Ren\u00E9e Elise Goldsberry in a spot-on performance as a bourgeois princess)."
,"Mike\u2019s home is the setting for most of the second act, and I don\u2019t want to tell you too much about what happens there. If you\u2019re a New York theater addict, you probably know that Ms. Goldsberry (who appeared in the musical \"The Color Purple\") is African-American. But just because \"Good People\" is about South Boston, a site notorious for racial strife, doesn\u2019t mean that Mr. Lindsay-Abaire is going to set a match to working-class prejudices. He\u2019s more clever than that. He plays the race card here only to suggest that for his purposes it\u2019s irrelevant."
,"The social dichotomy being explored isn\u2019t a matter of black and white. It\u2019s who does and doesn\u2019t escape from where he or she comes from. Perversely, it seems, it\u2019s the person with the thickest skin who has the best chances of rising above. Mr. Donovan makes Mike an artful study in willed amnesia, and the pain that surprises him when Margie summons the ghosts of their shared past is all the more palpable by not being directly expressed."
,"In the arguments that erupt throughout \"Good People\" - and they range from comradely sniping to the tossing of whatnots (a googly-eyed rabbit toy, as it happens) - characters often accuse one another of being too mean or too nice, too soft or too hard. They\u2019re right on all counts."
,"Whether it\u2019s Ms. Parsons\u2019s amiably avaricious landlady or Ms. Goldsberry\u2019s reflexively compassionate suburbanite, there\u2019s nothing pure about the goodness or badness of the folks who inhabit this play. This makes them among the most fully human residents of Broadway these days."

"The American artist George Condo made a splash in New York in the early 1980s with a line of surrealist-style figure paintings. It was tasty, erudite stuff, freaky but classy, a Mixmaster version of old master, with a big glop of Pop tossed in. Then he went to Europe, found an avid audience and stayed for a decade, mostly in Paris. To the New York art world, myopic and memoryless, he might have moved to Mars."
,"In 1995 he resettled in Manhattan, and has been there since, producing at high volume and exhibiting prominently without generating the kind of main-stage mojo that has made a younger artist like John Currin - who is hugely indebted to Mr. Condo\u2019s example - a star."
,"But now, finally, and with minimum fanfare, he\u2019s having his first institutional career survey here. It\u2019s titled \"George Condo: Mental States.\" It\u2019s at the New Museum. And it\u2019s sensational."
,"It demonstrates, among other things, what anyone who has tracked his career already knows. He\u2019s the missing link, or one of them (Carroll Dunham is another), between an older tradition of fiercely loony American figure painting - Willem de Kooning\u2019s grinning women, Philip Guston\u2019s ground-meat guys, Jim Nutt\u2019s cubist cuties, anything by Peter Saul - and the recent and updated resurgence of that tradition in the work of Mr. Currin, Glenn Brown, Nicole Eisenman, Dana Schutz and others."
,"Not that Mr. Condo - born in 1957 in New Hampshire - requires historical positioning to justify a survey. One glance at the installation of about 50 of his mainly fictional portraits on the New Museum\u2019s fourth floor tells you otherwise. Some of the paintings are stronger and stranger than others. But covering a long wall up to the ceiling, with no two images alike, they add up to a tour de force of stylistic multitasking and figurative variety."
,"Your first instinct is to spot sources for those styles and figures: Picasso, Arcimboldo, Cookie Monster, Goya, Looney Tunes. But you only go so far with this because Mr. Condo isn\u2019t much into wholesale appropriation. He\u2019s interested in invention. Everything is pretty much straight from his brain."
,"The earliest picture in the show, \"The Madonna,\" dates from 1982 and gives a basic sense of how Mr. Condo works. He painted his subject, a Renaissance staple, straightforwardly, then did something funny to it. He scraped some paint away so that the face became blurred and slightly separated from the head, like a slipping mask. This subtle effect turned a historically and ideologically loaded subject into contemporary caprice, though without taking the history and ideas away. They\u2019re here, but detached, like the Madonna\u2019s face."
,"Even after being messed around with, she looks fairly normal, which cannot be said of most of the figures surrounding her. These include other quasi-religious images - Mr. Condo grew up as a Roman Catholic - including a Mary Magdalene with bared breasts and sticking-out rodent ears. Taken as an icon it\u2019s deeply bizarre, yet it doesn\u2019t feel entirely irreverent, which makes it even odder."
,"Various gods of art history get their due and take their licks. The 1994 \"Memories of Rembrandt\" borrows the tawny palette of that Dutch artist\u2019s late self-portraits but reduces his facial features to a juicy stew of eyeballs and chunks of flesh. Throughout the show pieces of Picasso are everywhere, puzzled together, piled up like kindling, broken up, gnawed on, inserted wherever there\u2019s room. Mr. Condo clearly can\u2019t get enough of him."
,"News photographs of public personalities have served as models for portraits, and occasionally he leaves these people looking more or less like themselves, as he did a few years back in a series of 15 portraits of Elizabeth II of Britain. One of these images at the New Museum, \"The Insane Queen,\" is, in its zany way, almost respectful of her. Others - the queen with a detachable chin, a clown smile, a carrot stuck through her head - are not, and landed Mr. Condo in hot water when he brought them to the Tate Modern."
,"A few paintings, and several gilded bronze heads in the show, are named for characters - \"The Barber,\" \"The Butler,\" \"The Alcoholic\" - in Mr. Condo\u2019s private mythology of cultural types. And then there are portraits that are just mysterious hallucinations, floating free and unrooted."
,"In \"Red Antipodular Portrait\" a bug-eyed creature stares out apprehensively from behind cascades of scarlet fur. A kind of Bichon Maltese-Yosemite Sam hybrid, it exists in a one-species universe, unconnected to art or life or history. Yet it gives the impression of having feelings, so it evokes a complicated response: amusement with a tug of empathy. Isn\u2019t empathy going too far? Isn\u2019t this picture just a cartoon? Within the world of Mr. Condo\u2019s portraits, nothing is \"just\" anything."
,"The exhibition continues on the museum\u2019s third floor with groups of nonportrait paintings in which the content tends to be at least obliquely topical and emotions forcefully projected. Much of the work dates from after 9\/11; some of it alludes to recent Wall Street scandals. The prevailing mood shifts between confused sadness and suppressed anger."
,"In a small gallery labeled \"Melancholia\" male-and-female couples with tiny batlike faces, like the pair in \"The Stockbroker,\" pose in embattled silence. A black-suited executive stands beneath a suspended carrot, once a lure, now a sword of Damocles. Jesus appears. Child size, dwarfed by darkness, he\u2019s a little mound of raw matter with rodent teeth, startled eyes and flowers - or maybe thorns - laced through his stringy hair."
,"The adjoining gallery, with the theme of \"Manic Society,\" has the opposite kind of energy, clamorous and violent. Copulating lovers snarl like beasts; a priest with a Francis Bacon mouth lets out a scream. In an extraordinary painting called \"Uncle Joe\" a hirsute man with a demonic smile relaxes with a cigarette and a bottle of wine on a patch of grass, unaware that he\u2019s at the edge of a precipice."
,"In its third and last room a show of many surprises concludes with yet another one: a sampling of the abstract painting that Mr. Condo has been doing almost since he career began. His version of abstraction bears the same relationship to the traditional nonobjective thing as his portraits do to conventional portraiture. It\u2019s different, but if it\u2019s interesting, who cares?"
,"\"Dancing to Miles\" and \"Internal Constellation\" look, from a distance, like exercises in nuanced color and tone. But as you come closer, intricate, all-over networks of imagery come into focus: popping eyes, open mouths, breasts, hands, heads, all recognizable from the portraits. The patterns are so detailed and attention demanding as to be exhausting. Two paintings from 2010 with larger, cubistic forms are easier to see, but they\u2019re too Picassoid for comfort. They smudge a fine line between emulation and imitation, always a danger for artists who have a naturally ventriloqual grasp of styles."
,"The miracle is that Mr. Condo doesn\u2019t succumb to imitation more often, or doesn\u2019t in this survey, which has been scrupulously selected and edited by Ralph Rugoff, director of the Hayward Gallery in London, and Laura Hoptman, a former senior curator at the New Museum and now at the Museum of Modern Art. They are also responsible for a superlative installation, one that demonstrates, for the first time, that there are ways to exhibit painting effectively in this museum\u2019s high, tight, object-squelching spaces."
,"But much of that effectiveness can be attributed to the artist they\u2019re dealing with. Mr. Condo is not a producer of single precious items consistent in style and long in the making. If that\u2019s what you want from painting, he\u2019ll disappoint you. He\u2019s an artist of variety, plentitude and multiformity. He needs to be seen in an environment that presents him not as a virtuoso soloist but as the master of the massed chorale, and that\u2019s what Mr. Rugoff and Ms. Hoptman have done."

"Rembrandt\u2019s jowly, battered face glows like a night light in the great late self-portrait from 1658 at the Frick Collection. And it glows more brightly than ever now that layers of old varnish have been cleaned away."
,"Colors - the gold of the artist\u2019s shirt, the wine-red of his Middle Easternish sash, the pink of the chafe mark on his chin - are rich. For the first time in memory the shape of his cap, a floppy black beret in an antique style, is clearly visible against the dark ground."
,"To celebrate the painting\u2019s return from a restorative stay in the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s conservation labs, the Frick has awarded it pride of place right at the center of things in the wood-paneled Oval Room. There it\u2019s flanked by the collection\u2019s other two glorious Rembrandts, \"The Polish Rider\" and the portrait of Nicolaes Ruts. And it hangs across from a pair of ex-Rembrandts, \"Old Women with a Book,\" now attributed to Carel van der Pluym, and \"Portrait of a Young Artist,\" admirable painter unknown."
,"No museum in the city is more adept than the Frick at capitalizing on what it owns. Spiff up a picture, repaint some walls and - presto! - you have a show. But the exhibition called \"Rembrandt and His School: Masterworks from the Frick and Lugt Collections\" offers more. In addition to paintings we know, it gives us a handful of Frick prints we seldom see, and - the big attraction - a gallery of Rembrandt drawings brought from Europe."
,"Henry Clay Frick (1849-1919) and his Gilded Age peers would have been pleased with all this. Rembrandt was their man. Why? His paintings, with their encrusted surfaces, have an inherent look of luxe. And there were lots of them available in a cash-strapped Europe at the turn of the 20th century. Also, Rembrandt\u2019s demographic was attractive: northern European, Protestant, merchant class - and Protestant without churchiness (at least if you stuck with portraits), and merchant class with a new-money social lift, of the kind that let America\u2019s wealthy robbers and industrialists think of themselves as barons and czars."
,"Finally this artist came with a brave, sad story: visionary outsider, ahead of his time, shunned by his world, painting only for himself. That was enough for Frick, even if the tale wasn\u2019t entirely true. In reality Rembrandt had been an art world entrepreneur of Continental stature - dealer, collector, art adviser, teacher - with a lucrative painting and printmaking practice. And when hard times hit, they didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Rembrandt was heedless in his habits, spending what he earned, living on credit, signing onto bad deals. One thing went sour, then everything did, and he lost his shirt."
,"The 1658 self-portrait dates from that time. He was 52 when he painted it. A year earlier he\u2019d been forced to hawk his art collection. Soon he would lose his home. He kept painting, not primarily to work out his feelings but to bring in some guilders. And it was with the market in mind that he took the attention-grabbing style he\u2019d been developing and pushed it hard: splashy strokes, chunky surfaces, tonal contrasts that could be read from across a room."
,"That late style - tactile, almost sculptural - worked its magic on a young collector named Frederik Johannes Lugt (1884-1970), who picked up Rembrandt drawings and prints during his teens in Amsterdam. Lugt went on to amass encyclopedic holdings in European works on paper, creating the Fondation Custodia in Paris to house them. Two years ago the Frick exhibited the foundation\u2019s French drawings. For this show it has borrowed 18 Rembrandt drawings, 11 of his prints and work by a posse of followers."
,"A few of the drawings are superbly finished. \"Interior With Saskia in Bed\" is one. Usually assumed to depict Rembrandt\u2019s invalid wife attended by a nurse or maid, it is vaguely dated to within the two years before Saskia\u2019s death in 1642. That neither the subject nor date can be confirmed doesn\u2019t make the picture any less poignant. With sinewy skeins of ink, and pools and streaks of wash, Rembrandt gives a bourgeois bedroom the shadowed silence of an aisle chapel in a church."
,"Other drawings are looser, snapshots of life, terrestrial and otherwise. A woman coos over a baby spooked by a dog. A prostitute gingerly relieves a dozing client of his purse. An angel, wings aflutter, startles a prophet. A female martyr meets her end behind a bonfire of scribbles so dense as to half-obscure the scene."
,"The exhibition curators - Colin B. Bailey, Margaret Iacono and Joanna Sheers, all of the Frick - devote a second gallery to Rembrandt\u2019s pupils. Some, like Lambert Doomer, were assiduous copiers of the master\u2019s drawings. Others, like Govert Flinck, hewed closely to his style, as did Ferdinand Bol, whose jittery \"Elijah Sleeping Beneath a Tree\" was a Rembrandt not too long ago."
,"We get only a flash of the keenest talent here, the short-lived Carel Fabritius, in a drawing not even certainly by him. And we find lots of a dimmish bulb named Gerbrand van den Eeckhout. In genres he covered the waterfront. You could plug him in anywhere, from history painting to book design, and he\u2019d get the job done, though without the gleam that Rembrandt brought to everything."
,"To see the difference, compare van den Eeckhout\u2019s placidly capable \"Youth Smoking\" with any of eight self-portrait etchings by Rembrandt that round out the Lugt display. All but one of the etchings is from the early 1630s, when he moved from Leiden to Amsterdam to open a studio. There he became an instant dot-com type - big house, status wife, power job - but with a crazy rebel streak."
,"You see it in the self-portrait etchings. (They are in a tradition of depicting moral and psychological portraits, but as always, Rembrandt pushed tradition in idiosyncratic directions.) They\u2019re like a series of Monty Python skits, with Rembrandt playing all the parts: metrosexual masher with puffy Titian sleeves; nerdy accountant hoarding his receipts; saber-wielding pooh-bah with a tam-o\u2019-shanter crown. An incorrigible mugger, he changes expression from print to print. He scowls ferociously; he mopes; he smiles a goofy, stoned \"What, me worry?\" smile."
,"Over the years Lugt assembled a near-complete set of Rembrandt\u2019s prints; Frick bought some too, but unadventurously, and just a few. Self-portraits are not among the 10 examples installed in the small Cabinet gallery near the lobby. Instead there are classic landscapes and, oddly, religious scenes: \"Christ Preaching,\" also known as \"The Hundred Guilder Print\"; \"Christ Presented to the People,\" also called \"Ecce Homo\"; and so on. They\u2019re wonderful things and seldom shown, but after the self-portrait etchings they feel a little staid."
,"Was Frick familiar with the loose-cannon Rembrandt of the etchings? Whether he knew it or not, he was, because the same Rembrandt appears, older, quieter, but still acting out, in the 1658 self-portrait painting. Current scholarship tells us that 17th century Dutch artists didn\u2019t use self-portraiture as a vehicle for personal probing, that Rembrandt\u2019s princely orientalist drag in the Frick painting was intended neither as a statement of outsiderness nor as a cue to some private drama about losing a fortune but keeping your soul."
,"No, the get-up was functional. It would have been understood by everyone at the time as form of professional advertising, a way for an ambitious artist symbolically to remind his clientele, actual and potential, that he was a player in art history\u2019s royal line."
,"No doubt that explanation holds true for most artists of the day. But, I\u2019m sorry, the artist we\u2019re talking about here is Rembrandt - who, to judge by even the small amount of work in this modest show - probed the depths of practically every person and situation he encountered, took everything to heart and made a life and a living out of being in drag of one kind or another."
,"Not an outsider? This man who, over and over, embarrassed himself in front of the world and keeps embarrassing us because we\u2019re never sure how to react him, whether to laugh or cry?"
,"Only one thing\u2019s for sure: You can clean his paintings, but you can\u2019t clean up his act, which glows brighter each time we experience it, which is why we keep coming back."
,"\"Rembrandt and His School: Masterworks from the Frick and Lugt Collections\" is on view through May 15 at the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org."

"Africa is everywhere, so pervasive in our lives that we barely see it. Since it is in all likelihood the continent where human evolution began, it is literally in the bloodstream of everyone. DNA aside, huge portions of everyday life and cultural achievement are unthinkable without Africa."
,"What would Modern art be like if Matisse had never gone to Morocco or if he, Picasso and the German Expressionists had never set eyes on the sculptural innovations of sub-Saharan Africa? Very hard to say. And popular music? Around the world, it incorporates sounds and rhythms that originated in Africa. More locally, jazz - not Abstract Expressionism - was the first American art form of international stature."
,"\"The Global Africa Project\" at the Museum of Arts & Design tries to survey this pervasiveness, in terms of contemporary visual endeavors of all kinds: jewelry, fashion, architecture, basketry, ceramics, painting, utilitarian design. This sprawling cornucopia has been wrested into existence by Lowery Stokes Sims, former director of the Studio Museum in Harlem and, since 2007, international curator at the Museum of Arts & Design; and Leslie King-Hammond, former dean of graduate studies at the Maryland Institute College of Art and, since 2006, founding director of the institute\u2019s Center for Race and Culture."
,"This show presents 200 works by nearly 120 people, teams and collectives. It represents artists, designers, artisans, D.I.Y. improvisers and people engaged in various combinations of those already fuzzy job descriptions, toiling in ways that blur aesthetics, sociology and philosophy."
,"Astoundingly ambitious for a relatively small institution, \"Global Africa\" aims, in the words of its news release, to explore the \"impact of African visual culture on contemporary art, craft and design around the world.\" Unsurprisingly, the exhibition does not fully meet that tall order. It suffers from an excess of high-end luxury items and a shortage of genuine quality-of-life-changing design solutions. And unfortunately, it almost completely ignores Africa north of the Sahara. It is also plagued by too much ersatz stuff in all categories."
,"But ultimately this show\u2019s strengths surpass its weaknesses, or maybe merge with them. If it lacks coherence, that is because there is none to be revealed. While there are individual references to distinctly African traditions and formal vocabularies, no single look or style emerges, and that\u2019s the point. The show\u2019s massing of information and accomplishment is often incredibly moving."
,"As you make your way through the crowded displays, you can almost hear the seams of the building creak under the strain. Though that sound may sometimes be simply your brain, boggled by the inundation of insights and attitudes, or even the fresh juxtaposition of familiar entities."
,"I loved seeing the work of Joyce Scott, the Baltimore bead sculptor extraordinaire, in the same vitrine as the beaded and sequined voudon flags, or drapos, of the Haitian artist George Valris. Likewise, the nearby grouping of J. D. \u2019Okhai Ojeikere\u2019s photographs of the ostentatiously sculptural headdresses and hairdos of African women, with the majestic hats of Evetta Perry, owner of Harlem\u2019s Heaven Hat Boutique, and the softer, nonetheless crownlike, crocheted hats of the artist Xenobia Bailey."
,"Most but not all of the participants are of African descent. One exception is the Italian photographer Daniele Tamagni, who is represented by photographs of proudly stylish Congolese dandies - mostly men - known as the Society for the Advancement of People of Elegance. His images are among the exhibition\u2019s several photographic high points - along with the irreverent, cultural polyglot self-portraits of the Nigerian-born Ik\u00E9 Ud\u00E9, and the real-life style mixings captured in Nontsikelelo Veleko\u2019s street photographs of imaginatively dressed South Africans."
,"And most but not all of the participants work in the United States, Europe, the Caribbean or Africa. The exceptions are Ramijabi Madarsahib and Kairumbi Karimsahib, members of the Siddi Women\u2019s Quilting Cooperative in Karnataka, India, descended from East Africans who started coming to India as early as the seventh century as sailors, slaves, servants and merchants. Each woman is represented by a small, bright, gemlike quilt made from discarded saris. The loose geometric patterns are a result of a process of all-over stitching (back and front) that is different from traditional American piecework."
,"Call them art, crafts or textiles, these quilts are among the most extraordinary aesthetic objects to be seen in any New York museum right now. If everything else here measured up to them, this show would be great beyond belief."
,"Despite its ups and downs, the exhibition delivers overreaching insights with inarguable immediacy. One of these is that categorical neatness is an exaggerated curatorial value. All museums should periodically assemble shows that ignore the distinctions among contemporary art, design and craft. The resulting friction between nonfunctional and functional, spiritual and practical, handmade and machine-made, and professional and self-taught is music to the eyes. What\u2019s more, it is closer to the way visual culture really happens."
,"Other insights relate more directly to life. Foremost is the do-it-yourself ethic. Nothing happens if you do nothing. Taking action is a way to take responsibility, but also a way to inspire others to act. And often something can be made out of almost nothing."
,"Equally important is the role of well-made and\/or beautiful things, functional and not, as life-sustaining nourishment. The visual vitality of objects foments human vitality."
,"One example argues both points: Tyree Guyton\u2019s Heidelberg Project, documented here in photographs and a video. It began one day in the late 1980s when Mr. Guyton, with help from his family, began to clean out an abandoned house on their drug-dealer-infested block in Detroit. Mr. Guyton arranged the gathered debris in colorful assemblages and reliefs in vacant lots and went on to clean out and decorate other houses and lots in the neighborhood. Heart-warming, yes, and it also began a process that helped rid the neighborhood of drugs."
,"Another pertinent concept at large in the show is recycling trash and, related, the repurposing of existing materials. This occurs in the cosmopolitan dresses made from several patterned fabrics by the Nigerian-born fashion designer Duro Olowu, who lives in London; a sturdy cabinet made from recycled metal oil drums by the Senegalese furniture designer Ousmane M\u2019Baye; and a marvelously evocative columnar sculpture, \"Tchin-Tchin, BP!,\" that Romuald Hazoum\u00E9, born in Benin, fashioned from plastic oil canisters. Inspired by the BP oil spill this year, it transcends the artist\u2019s description of it as a kind of \"ironic\" Champagne flute to merge suggestions of human, tree and anthill."
,"Recycling is also apparent in the industrial design team of Birsel & Seck\u2019s low, curving stools, made in Dakar from one of the country\u2019s most plentiful byproducts: discarded plastic bottles and bags. Wahala Temi\u2019s \"Afrikea\" chair - made from Ikea stools - puts a conceptual spin on it."
,"There are seemingly stark contrasts of intention and effect. Among the more opulent inclusions are the handsome hammered silver vessels of Ndidi Ekubia, a British-born daughter of African immigrants, and the BMW hand-painted with geometric patterns by the South African muralist Esther Mahlangu (surely the best result of the company\u2019s self-serving art-car campaign)."
,"Among the least opulent displays is a book set in a Plexiglas sleeve on the wall. \"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind: Creating Currents of Electricity and Hope\" tells the inspiring story of William Kamkwamba of the landlocked Republic of Malawi. Forced to forgo school as a teenager to help his family survive, Mr. Kamkwamba scavenged materials to build a windmill that took electricity and clean water to his village for the first time."
,"But again and again, simplistic oppositions don\u2019t hold up. It helps to see each item on display as a marker for a larger story, like Mr. Kamkwamba\u2019s book, to be extracted from labels or the show\u2019s catalog. The glass-bead necklaces of Nomoda Ebenezer Djaba, also known as Mr. Cedi, have an attractive luminosity. The label reveals that they are made of recycled bottles, a process, the catalog elaborates, that has helped Mr. Cedi make his craft, handed down through several generations, more viable. This exhibition is full of such local success stories, in which craft traditions, recycling and human ingenuity coalesce, and lives are changed and even saved."
,"\"The Global Africa Project\" has a brilliant, concept-compressing name. The glowing alloy of its first two words - \"Global Africa\" - invokes a large continent and its worldwide influence, while \"Project\" paradoxically signals open-endedness: work in progress, loose ends, an interim report rather than a finished exhibition."
,"It is the kind of show that had to be done, that deserves to be done better and that may take a few attempts to get right. The Museum of Arts & Design should consider making it a recurring, truly continuing project, like the Whitney Museum\u2019s biennial or the New Museum\u2019s triennial. Every four or five years, take a trans-medium look at Africa and its global legacy; they will never become less important."
,"\"The Global Africa Project\" continues through May 15 at the Museum of Arts & Design, 2 Columbus Circle; (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org."

"Some stars take longer than others to come into telescopic range. Such is the case with Luis Camnitzer, who, in his early 70s and with a half-century career behind him, is just now having his first New York museum survey."
,"The show, at El Museo del Barrio, is terse, almost to the vanishing point in places, as might be expected from one of the pioneers of 1960s Conceptualism. Much of what\u2019s here is based on printed language: cryptic propositions, random lists of words and descriptive phrases - unmoored from, or very loosely tethered to, other spare-to-barely-there visual matter."
,"As elusive as the work looks, there\u2019s a truth-in-advertising directness to it. From an early point, Mr. Camnitzer made clear that for him art was not about claiming mastery of a medium or refining an identifiable style. He wanted to use very basic, unglamorous visual and linguistic tools to clear a zone for thinking, without interference from the market or pressure to be predictable."
,"He has remained steadfast in that quixotic resolve, supporting himself primarily as a teacher and critic. Only fairly recently has the mainstream art world begun to show some serious interest in meeting him on his own terms."
,"Mr. Camnitzer was born in Germany in 1937. Two years later his family emigrated to Uruguay, and he grew up in Montevideo. He went to art school there, then briefly studied sculpture in Munich, before coming to New York City in the early 1960s, at which point he was making prints and topical cartoons, Expressionist in style."
,"With its potential for cheap production and wide distribution, printmaking has had a long history in Latin America, particularly as a political vehicle. And its utopian dimension made it a popular medium in the United States in the context of the civil rights and antiwar movements of the 1960s. But Mr. Camnitzer began to find his skill with Expressionism to be a problem. It gained him attention, but it was too easy, demanded minimal thought. He felt he had to throw a wrench into the works."
,"With two \u00E9migr\u00E9 South American artists - Liliana Porter, whom he married, and Jos\u00E9 Guillermo Castillo - he founded the New York Graphics Workshop in a borrowed studio apartment in Manhattan, and began to push his printmaking in experimental directions, using unorthodox formats (printing on the side of a ream of paper, on cookies), and taking words as his primary visual elements."
,"In 1966 he made what he considers his first Conceptual piece, which was closer to a relief sculpture than to a print. It consisted of two unpunctuated phrases run together - \"This is a Mirror You Are a Written Sentence\" - spelled out in raised black plastic lettering against the light ground of what looked like an ordinary pegboard."
,"What did the words mean? That our reaction, positive or negative, to art is entirely scripted by habit and context? Or is there some other meaning relating to psychoanalytic theories of perception of a kind that fascinated many Latin American artists at that time? One thing was certain: the piece was intended to provoke thought and questions."
,"Other such works followed immediately, all making unorthodox uses of workaday media. From 1966 came a series of adhesive labels rubber-stamped and offset-printed with absurdist architectural proposals: \"Ten story building with Styrofoam flowing out of the windows,\" \"A room with the center point of the ceiling touching the floor.\" In the spirit of democratic distribution, the labels were suitable for mailing."
,"In the 1968 installation called \"Living Room,\" which has been recreated at El Museo, Mr. Camnitzer cooked up a full-scale architectural interior from words. All of the room\u2019s elements - windows, desk, bookcase, carpet - were defined entirely by printed labels stuck to a gallery\u2019s walls and floor. Labels printed with the word \"window\" outlined a window; labels printed \"bookcase\" outlined a bookcase. The piece was meant to be satirical: how boring bourgeois homes were, including his own, with everything generically tagged. At the same time, he was gladdened to see that the words could affect physical behavior. He observed that although visitors felt free to walk straight across the area of the floor marked \"carpet,\" they tended to walk around the area marked \"desk.\""
,"It\u2019s worth noting that Mr. Camnitzer began using printed language as a primary art medium slightly before better-known North American Conceptualists like Lawrence Weiner. The catalog reminds us of this, chiefly to emphasize that postwar Latin American vanguard art was not, as it is often taken to have been, a passive recipient of Euro-American influence, but had developed ideas in advance of, in tandem with, or entirely apart from, art going on elsewhere."
,"For years Mr. Camnitzer made apartness a kind of personal ethic, which didn\u2019t mean that he ignored the art market and its arbitrary values. To the contrary, he has commented on these subjects repeatedly. In a long series of print-based works from the 1960s onward, he offered his signature for sale, either hand-written or in different print formats - laser-cut, silk-screened, or ink-stamped - and priced according to conventional market hierarchies based on original versus copy, glamour of medium, etc. The hand-written signature was marketed as a master drawing. Ink-stamped signatures, with the purchaser doing the stamping, were low-end products."
,"With such work , Mr. Camnitzer was a precursor of the strain of recent Conceptual art known as institutional critique, which takes the art industry as its target. At the same time, though, he was directing his attention to more serious political subjects."
,"Although he didn\u2019t leave Uruguay as a refugee, he had a strong reaction to the military dictatorship that eventually took control there. And his photo-and-text-based project called \"From the Uruguayan Torture Series,\" from 1983-84, remains one of the most potent, under-your-skin responses made by any artist to the nightmare phenomenon of the \"disappeared\" in Latin America."
,"Although widely exhibited a few years ago at, among other places, El Museo, this piece isn\u2019t in the survey, which in general de-emphasizes Mr. Camnitzer\u2019s topical and polemical work. This may be because of the source of the material exhibited: everything is from the permanent collection of a single museum, the Daros Latinamerica in Zurich, which opened in 2000."
,"Whether the Daros curators, Hans-Michael Herzog and Katrin Steffen, were constrained in their choices by what was on hand, or whether they set out to offer a particular view of Mr. Camnitzer\u2019s career, I don\u2019t know. But a particular, and partial, view is what we get."
,"There is certainly some polemical work here. The 1991 installation called \"The Journey,\" consisting of three big carving knives thrusting out of the gallery wall and engraved with the names \"Nina,\" \"Pinta\" and \"Santa Maria,\" is a blatant anti-colonial statement. It\u2019s also a reminder that anti-colonial impulse shaped much Conceptual art from Latin America, distinguishing it from Duchamp-inspired Conceptualism in the United States. (It says much about the distance Mr. Camnitzer kept from international art world trends that his art stays close to a Latin American Conceptual model, even though he created most of it while living in and around New York.)"
,"What the show conveys most decisively, though, is a poetic side of Mr. Camnitzer\u2019s art. Various writers have compared his text-driven pieces to concrete poetry - a genre based on how words function visually, rather than verbally, and that takes the instability of language as a given. The artist himself rejects this reading, insisting that he has no interest in poetry, even dislikes what he sees as its artificiality and penchant for ego-centered sentimentality."
,"But if you don\u2019t view poetry as sentimental and ego-fixated by definition, and instead view it as a form of language that can evoke visual images and infuse them with ideas in peculiarly expansive combinations, then poetic isn\u2019t such a bad description of some of what\u2019s here."
,"A constellation of studio-floor scraps floats across a gallery wall, each scrap labeled with a single, random written word - \"Error,\" \"Duty,\" \"Doubt\" - that hints at large histories that we overlook and sweep away. In a photograph, we see a hand - the artist\u2019s?, God\u2019s? - holding a thin metal outline of a book against the sky, as if to absorb the cosmos. In a 2001-2 installation, stacks of real books fill two rectangular holes in the wall and are cemented into place, as if to protect from an invasion or to prevent escape from a bunker-library at the end of the world."
,"This piece, called \"Window,\" identifies a trail of darkness and pessimism that runs through Mr. Camnitzer\u2019s art, and different surveys - there will surely be others - will want to track that. But the present sighting of his career is a bright one, and El Museo, which has come up with an immaculate installation in its modestly scaled spaces, is an ideal observatory."
,"\"Luis Camnitzer\" remains through May 29 at El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem; (212) 831-7272."

"There are pros and cons to \"The Great Upheaval: Modern Art From the Guggenheim Collection, 1910-1918\" at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. It exemplifies a museum trying to make the most of its permanent collection, combining fiscal sense with in-house creativity. Money is tight, and collections are often roomy, full of underexposed artwork awaiting the illumination of curatorial insight. This is a good thing."
,"But there can be too much of a good thing. This show has all but absorbed \"Broken Forms: European Modernism From the Guggenheim Collection,\" a smaller, warm-up exhibition with a similarly cataclysmic title organized by the same curators that closed at the museum just last month."
,"This time around Tracey Bashkoff, chief curator of collections and exhibitions, and Megan Fontanella, assistant curator of collections and provenance, have been assigned the museum\u2019s entire spiral rotunda, mounting a meticulous and spacious installation that is almost too serene for its own good. The totality suggests a kind of time capsule, as if we\u2019ve journeyed back to a show that might have been mounted at the Guggenheim 30 or 40 years ago. Sometimes the upheaval in question seems to be unfolding in slow motion, at a remove, with the sound off."
,"This exhibition both suffers and gains from the patchiness and idiosyncrasies of the Guggenheim\u2019s holdings in early modernism, whose strengths lie in German, Dutch and Russian art more than French. In the catalog Ms. Bashkoff tactfully writes that \"today the museum\u2019s holdings of modern art are by no means complete,\" and reminds us that the Guggenheim did not acquire its first painting by Henri Matisse until 1982."
,"The version of modernism showcased in \"The Great Upheaval,\" which includes about 25 percent of the museum\u2019s holdings in painting and sculpture from before 1920, is altogether different from the thoroughly French kind so successfully promulgated by the Museum of Modern Art. Picasso and Braque, along with Matisse, are here, but they take a back seat to Kandinsky, Malevich, Mondrian and Chagall, as well as the ever-dubious Franz Marc and lesser French artists like Robert Delaunay, Fernand L\u00E9ger and Andr\u00E9 Derain, whose \"Portrait of a Young Man\" (1913-14) shows him ignoring Cubism to expertly fine-tune C\u00E9zanne."
,"Thus this exhibition presents a useful alternative reading of a moment one century ago that in many ways remains foundational to our own. It places before the public some 90 paintings and two dozen sculptures and works on paper that date mainly from 1910 to 1918, by 45 artists, two-thirds of whom spent all or most of their careers outside France. And it tells us as much about the Guggenheim and its founders - Solomon R. Guggenheim and his adviser, the German artist Hilla Rebay - as the period under scrutiny."
,"That period is an intense eight-year spasm of European history, when the region lurched toward and then slogged through World War I, and modern art - born of Post-Impressionism, Fauvism and Cubism - spread like wildfire. Artists across the Continent and Russia distorted or splintered the forms of reality, trying to get at something newer and deeper. And, as indicated by the timelines that punctuate the show\u2019s chronological year-by-year installation, they were busily proving that creativity loves company, founding organizations, staging exhibitions and issuing manifestoes, especially beyond Paris, in Berlin, Munich, Moscow and Milan."
,"A new awareness of the physical possibilities of the art object is everywhere apparent in these works, and abstraction is constantly broached, if rarely embraced completely. There has perhaps never been a stylistic springboard as springy as Cubism, especially in certain hands from Russia. Malevich\u2019s \"Morning in the Village After Snowstorm\" (1912), Chagall\u2019s \"Flying Carriage\" (1913) and Liubov Popova\u2019s \"Birsk\" (1916) all put very different spins on similar ingredients: toned-down Cubist fracturing, jewel-like color, glowing light and folkloric themes."
,"But in other works there is also an anxiety about the loss of, and a consequent clinging to traditional, academic norms of representation. Artists venture forth tentatively. An example is Frantisek Kupka\u2019s 1909-10 painting of a monumental seated nude; its chiseled form is completely traditional even though its bright faceted colors are not. (The real Kupka surprise here is a small pastel study from 1911-12, in which bobbing forms are held in check by a series of crystalline structures. It is a wonderful thing, and an ancestor to the buoyant abstractions that Elizabeth Murray would produce in the 1980s.)"
,"Modernism also seems more like surface embellishment than structural change in much Italian Futurism, represented here by several works borrowed from the museum\u2019s sister institution, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice. The Futurists\u2019 best works here tend to be the most Cubist, among them Gino Severini\u2019s energetic \"Red Cross Train Passing a Village\" from 1915 (a Guggenheim-Rebay acquisition) and, from Venice, Carlo Carr\u00E0\u2019s dark, rubbery depiction of the vaulted ceiling of the Galleria in Milan."
,"Other artists shift back and forth in the vicinity of the new. Mondrian\u2019s \"Summer, Dune in Zeeland\" (1910) is stunning in its combination of simple form and glowing lavenders and yellows. His 1911 \"Still Life With Gingerpot I\" is more conventionally descriptive, yet the splintering lines indicate his embrace of Cubist structure, which sets him on the path to abstraction."
,"In the case of Juan Gris you may wonder if he is ever better than he is in \"Houses in Paris\" (1911), a proto-Cubist rendering of buildings that might almost have been carved from a single piece of soft, dove-gray stone. Its subtle shadings and gentle angles seem more complete than Gris\u2019s more classically Cubist paintings later in the exhibition. Similarly, more alive than many larger, more ambitious works in the exhibition is Ernst Ludwig Kirchner\u2019s little pastel sketch \"Head of a Woman\" (around 1909), whose garish colors and off-register lines give it a bit of the hallucinatory power of one of Warhol\u2019s images of Marilyn Monroe."
,"This exhibition never really coalesces into a larger picture. It provides, like the accompanying chronologies, a kind of skeleton outline, a sequence of random dots joined by a shared time frame. To some extent this is enough, but the arbitrariness of the project becomes overt at the top of the rotunda. Here, suddenly, it is 1914, and the last four years of the show - half its time span - is covered in the sixth and final ring of the spiral. Yes, a war was going on, but basically the Guggenheim doesn\u2019t really have the material to continue its account in any depth."
,"Still, there are wonderful, if disparate, things to consider. The museum\u2019s first Matisse, the 1916 \"Italian Woman,\" a remarkably severe painting in which the background plane is pried forward to cover the subject\u2019s right shoulder like a cape, shares a bay with a Modigliani nude and Brancusi\u2019s spindly \"Little French Girl (The First Step III)\" in carved wood. Three of Mondrian\u2019s soft-edged early grids levitate in another bay like stained-glass windows in a modern chapel. Oskar Kokoschka\u2019s \"Knight Errant\" (1915) recasts a dying soldier as a fully armored medieval hero expiring in an elaborately blue nocturnal landscape that must have been inspired by the receding vistas of the Northern Renaissance. And Kurt Schwitters, not yet the prestidigitator of modern detritus, is represented by the darkling \"Mountain Graveyard\" from 1919, a cross-filled Expressionist homage to Caspar David Friedrich that meditates on the war just ended and the wars to come."
,"\"The Great Upheaval: Modern Art From the Guggenheim Collection, 1910-1918\" runs through June 1 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street; (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org."

"It\u2019s 1912, and Pablo Picasso is in Paris, thinking: All right, what\u2019s next?"
,"A few years earlier he painted a killer picture, \"Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon.\" People had thrown up their hands in alarm; his friends hardly knew what to say. Energized by the fuss, he punched out variations on the theme: paintings of sharp-elbowed, wood-brown nude women, their bodies all ax-cut facets, set in pockets of shallow space."
,"He\u2019d changed history with this work. He\u2019d replaced the benign ideal of the Classical nude with a new race of sexually armed and dangerous beings. He\u2019d made art as much a problem as a pleasure. At the same time he left fundamentals unchanged. The human figure remained sovereign, abstraction unexplored. Painting was still a reflection of the world we knew, not an alternative reality with laws of its own."
,"So there were further leaps to take. And Picasso had to ask himself how far he was willing to go."
,"Quite far, it turned out, and exactly how far is the subject of \"Picasso: Guitars 1912-1914,\" a subtly buzzing manifesto of an exhibition that opens Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art. It\u2019s made up of 70 smallish, thematically related objects borrowed from hither and yon: paintings, drawings, collages and combinations thereof, along with two renowned sculptures, one seen complete for the first time since it left Picasso\u2019s studio after his death."
,"Piece by piece it\u2019s entrancing. Taken as a whole it\u2019s a record of a brief but intense revolution that generated some of the most challenging ideas in modern art."
,"By 1912, inspired by his friend Georges Braque, Picasso turned his attention away from figures to still lifes. And the two men, working side by side - \"like roped mountain climbers,\" in Braque\u2019s words - developed what would come to be called Cubism."
,"Cubism was, initially, far less a style (though it became that) than a way of rethinking art\u2019s place in the world. To some artists at the beginning of the 20th century that place felt uncertain. Photography\u2019s recording eye had made realist painting redundant. At the same time, with old social, scientific, religious and political certainties giving way, the very definition of reality was up for grabs."
,"What kind of art could find a foothold on this shifting ground? An art that rethought its relationship to \"real.\" On the one hand, this art would plug itself into the everyday world (as opposed to the academy); on the other, it would create a world of its own, one that embraced constant experimentation but that also remodeled and repurposed existing traditions."
,"This is the kind of thinking Picasso and Braque were doing in that original Cubist moment. Given the complexities they were juggling, it\u2019s a wonder they didn\u2019t either short-circuit or get lost in some byway and lose momentum. But they didn\u2019t. \"Above all we were very concentrated,\" Braque later wrote. And in MoMA\u2019s Picasso show, where Braque is invisible but ever present, you can see that."
,"One obvious way they streamlined their task was by narrowing their inventory of still-life elements: wine glasses, bottles, coffee cups and musical instruments - violins and guitars - in different combinations, and that\u2019s about it. All of these things were commonly found in the cheap bars and cafes where artists congregated to get warm when their studios got cold. So Cubism was already claiming a reality of its own, one that was part of the everyday world, but not."
,"In the earliest work in the show Picasso is still clinging to his identity as a painter, an identity that, in the traditional art-media hierarchy - a hierarchy that Cubism set out to collapse - ranked highest. An elaborate composition of sliced-up objects and tipsy stacked planes titled \"Bottle, Guitar, and Pipe,\" from the fall of 1912, it has the earmarks of a dense collage, right down to a bit of cut-and-paste-style text and faint shadows showing between the stacked planes. But the shadows and text are brushed on. The whole thing is oil on canvas."
,"Soon, though, Picasso is expanding his formal repertory. \"Guitar, Sheet Music, and Glass,\" from later in the fall of 1912, is a collage, made from cut newspaper, sheet music and faux-wood paper. A pasted-in drawing is the only exercise in studio skills. The patterns of the faux-wood paper are hand painted, but probably not by Picasso."
,"And in a particularly snazzy collage called \"Guitar,\" dated March 31, 1913, there\u2019s no paint at all. Pictorial realism, with its artificial mirroring of nature, is absent. What\u2019s left is Cubist realness: stuff glued to other funky stuff. There\u2019s a ghost of the shape of a guitar in there somewhere, all cut up, but no volume, no depth, no effort to refer to any outside reality for validation."
,"In pieces like this Picasso seems to favor intriguing shapes over cohesive forms, the way his friend Gertrude Stein privileged sound over sense in \"Tender Buttons,\" which was written the year before this collage was made."
,"Today, nearly a century on, it\u2019s hard to grasp how disturbing such work was to some at the time. More than just an example of bad-boy high jinks, it was perceived as a slap in the face to beauty, idealism and decorum, proof of European culture on the slide."
,"People got angry. When the Parisian arts journal Les Soir\u00E9es de Paris ran a photograph of one of Picasso\u2019s sculptural guitars constructed from paperboard and string, furious letters came in; subscriptions were canceled."
,"That sculpture is the centerpiece of this MoMA show. Picasso made it in Paris sometime in the fall or winter of 1912. About the size of a real guitar, it now looks achingly fragile and was, of course, never playable. And it embodies many of the aesthetic questions that Cubism raised:"
,"What\u2019s real? And why is one version of real better than another? What\u2019s \"high,\" what\u2019s \"low\"? What makes durable worthier than ephemeral? What makes an object art, and an idea not?"
,"Precisely because it evokes such ideas, the paperboard guitar, along with a later sheet-metal version of it, also in the show, was one of the most influential sculptures of the 20th century. Picasso seems to have valued it highly. He photographed it in 1912 and a few years later disassembled and packed it away. Despite requests, he didn\u2019t exhibit it during his lifetime. He left it to MoMA at his death, in 1973."
,"In 2005 an art historian at the University of Pennsylvania, Christine Poggi, inquired whether the sculpture, as MoMA had exhibited it, was missing a component, a round slice of cardboard that had originally formed a \"tabletop\" on which the guitar had rested. A search of museum storage was undertaken. The tabletop, cut from a cardboard box, was located and put in place."
,"Plans to display the restored sculpture supplied the pretext for a larger show. Its organizers - Anne Umland, a curator in the department of painting and sculpture, and Blair Hartzell, a curatorial assistant - really ran with the idea. They put together an exceptional ensemble of works that are wonderful and rare - will we ever again lay eyes on the privately owned 1913 \"Bar Table With Guitar,\" a paper collage held together entirely with pins? - and that give a vivid sense of the degree to which Picasso stretched himself during two watershed years."
,"He didn\u2019t have an easy time. He was a born figure painter, and it must have been a punishment to try to stick to Braque\u2019s still-life diet, and he didn\u2019t entirely. The body keeps turning up in Picasso\u2019s Cubism, with guitars morphing into torsos and violins into heads."
,"And though he traveled far, he had his limits. He never made the great free-fall from representation into abstraction. He came awfully close in the little 1913 collage \"Head,\" on loan from the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh. And he might have gone all the way had he not added - was it a last-minute touch? - a pencil-dot eye to the simple arrangement of a white cone on a dark base."
,"As for Cubism, at least in its early form, it was shot down by World War I. By the time that horror ended, no one wanted to hear about the instability of reality, or the relativism of values, aesthetic or otherwise. Which isn\u2019t to say that Cubism died. As a style, it flourished, but that\u2019s another story."
,"And after 1914 Picasso embarked on a new story, or rather picked up an old one. He went back to the figure, in Ingres-like portraits, chiton-clad maidens and fleshy, somnolent Rubenesque nudes, who seem to know nothing at all about the race of erotic warriors he had introduced years before, or about the startling little worlds-within-the-world collages, so audacious and so delicate, that survive from the Cubist revolution, which was Picasso\u2019s very finest hour."

"The New Museum has become a busy place this year, and it is not yet even March. In January it opened a popular tribute to the market-hardy paintings of George Condo. Now it is offering a startlingly excellent resurrection of the prescient Post-Minimalist renegade Lynda Benglis and her gaudy, multidexterous and often gender-bending segues among Process, Performance and Body Art."
,"Ms. Benglis is something of a mythic character, as many female artists of the 1960s and early \u201970s are by now. Working in pigmented latex, beeswax or polyurethane foam and even glitter, she made daring, often ephemeral or fragile works that have plenty of historical weight but little market presence."
,"Permanence seems to have been the last thing on her mind, at least in the early years. Many pieces were temporary installations that did not survive; others had the kind of willful fragility that makes collectors nervous. One of her most famous works is nothing but a brilliantly orchestrated magazine ad: a performance-slash-photograph that ran in the November 1974 issue of Artforum for which she posed, taut and well-oiled, wearing only a pair of rhinestone-studded cat-eye sunglasses and wielding a dildo."
,"Ms. Benglis was born near New Orleans in Lake Charles, La., in 1941. Her father was the American-born son of Greek immigrants who returned to their homeland, and she visited her grandmother in Megisti, on the Greek island of Kastellorizo, several times as a child and young woman. The decorative bravado of New Orleans Mardi Gras and the figurative tradition of Classical Greek sculpture are two points on the aesthetic compass worth keeping in mind when encountering her works."
,"After studying art at the H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College for Women at Tulane University in New Orleans, she arrived in New York in the mid-1960s and proceeded to become something of an art star. In 1970 she was anointed by Life magazine, with an article that compared her to Jackson Pollock. It showed her pouring big, bright, irresistible slurps of latex on the floor, making a resolutely abstract installation piece that spoke loud and clear of its own making. Borrowing variously from Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, Pop Art and Minimalism in their embrace of process, vivid, physically intrinsic color and nontraditional materials, the poured-latex pieces look these days about as bona-fide Post-Minimalist as you can get."
,"But while Ms. Benglis embraced her generation\u2019s devotion to soft, unstructured materials that had minds of their own, she abjured its predilection for gray-on-gray drabness or, at most, real-world color. She was on board with the concept of making art that didn\u2019t look like art, of avoiding traditional forms of painting and sculpture by knocking their heads together. But she had no intention of relinquishing an iota of the visual power or immediacy staked out by preceding postwar art movements."
,"The New Museum organized this exhibition in concert with the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, the Netherlands; the Museum of Modern Art in Dublin; Le Consortium in Dijon, France; and the Museum of Art at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence. Given this broad-based genesis, the catalog is suitably profuse, full of essays, reproductions of long-lost installation pieces and series of works not represented in the show."
,"Usually this would be irritating. Ms. Benglis is a restless artist always trying new materials and techniques, undeterred by the prospect of diluting her brand or making works that don\u2019t necessarily scream Benglis at us. But the show\u2019s 50 works - including videos that predict the work of Paul McCarthy and Mike Kelley - span more than 40 years and touch most of the important bases. They have for the most part been elegantly installed by Massimiliano Gioni, the New Museum\u2019s chief curator."
,"From the beginning nothing was beyond the pale when it came to making a visual statement. Not even glowing in the dark, thanks to phosphorescent pigment. This is exemplified by the eerily glowing five-part \"Phantom,\" seen in a darkened gallery. Unexhibited since it was created on the spot at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kan., in 1971, it is the only intact survivor of six or eight ambitious foam-pour installations that Ms. Benglis made during these years. Its melting, cantilevered (and self-supporting) cascades of iridescent whiteness spring off the wall as if determined to escape all conventional art categories while burning holes in your visual memory - both of which they still do."
,"In the 1970s Ms. Benglis was constantly out there on her own, stopping traffic and irritating people with her innate sense of personal flamboyance, her penchant for formal excess and her calculated manipulations of art-world standards, the most extreme instance of which was of course the Artforum ad. It precipitated irate letters to the editor, the resignation of several longtime writers and the forcible separation of ad from magazine by various college librarians. (The catalog includes a photograph of an exfoliated magazine.)"
,"To this exhibition\u2019s credit the Artforum ad - which remains almost picture perfect in its heady confusion of gender, Hollywood and camp - is displayed in a vitrine in a back gallery, beside the Life magazine spread and across from five little-known grids of Polaroids from the same time that echo its overheated eroticism. It is but a small part of a much larger and more complex picture in which deviation, volatility and the body are explored along largely formal, abstract lines, with eccentric, often liquid materials reigning supreme."
,"There are two latex pieces - \"Blatt\" and \"Contraband,\" both from 1969 - at the New Museum. Slightly wrinkled and dusty, they still communicate an implicitly bodily, erotic juiciness. These works unleash Pollock\u2019s drips from the rhythmic ordering of his looping gestures, bypassing his famous \"dance\" for a more visceral, unruly conjuring of the body, almost turned inside out and reduced to a kind of puddle of slithering color."
,"This exhibition stresses Ms. Benglis\u2019s dual role as innovator and commentator, adept at extending ideas of her mostly male contemporaries while also skewing and skewering them with her own implicitly libidinous sensibility. The latex pieces are exuberant, Disneyfied retorts to Richard Serra\u2019s splashings of molten lead. Her narrow, jewel-colored wax paintings from the same time take the waxen surfaces of Brice Marden\u2019s early monochrome panel paintings to extremes: a brush width across and a brush stroke long, they maintain the integrity of each new layer of color with mouthwatering clarity, while building up a surface that feels dangerously (which is to say erotically) like skin itself."
,"From the foundation of the wax paintings and the latex pieces, this exhibition follows Ms. Benglis as she improvises her way from one series to the next. She adds foam and dimensionality to her floor pieces and then makes them leap off the wall in works like \"Phantom.\" In the mid-1970s she begins casting some foam sculptures in aluminum, lead and bronze, destroying them while contrasting their comical forms with the sober, more lasting materials of traditional sculpture."
,"Meanwhile the wax paintings, which here span from 1966 to 1972, give way to works like \"Hoofers I\" and \"Hoofers II,\" thin columns of aluminum screening covered with cheesecloth dipped in plaster that she swabbed with glitter. Next she knots these columns, evoking Pollock\u2019s dripped skeins in three dimensions and then adding Pollock-like drips of paint and glitter, as beautifully exemplified by the 1973 \"PSI.\" Later knots are sprayed with metal and then elaborated with Fortuny-like folds."
,"In one gallery \"Minos,\" a simple torsolike wall piece in gold leaf over chicken wire and plaster, from 1978, contrasts with the extravagant \"Zanzidae, From the Peacock Series,\" a 1979 wall piece that incorporates glass and plastic in various forms and wouldn\u2019t look out of place at Mardi Gras or in Zeffirelli\u2019s production of \"Turandot.\" Also here are more recent excursions into glass and ceramics, mossy rubberized foam and pigmented urethane, which has a jellylike translucence."
,"Whether you have been watching Ms. Benglis\u2019s varied career for decades or know her primarily from the latex pieces and her star turn in Artforum, this exhibition pulls together and elaborates her remarkable career in a thrilling way. It proves her work to be at once all over the place and very much of a piece, as well as consistently, irrepressibly ahead of its time. This would seem to be every renegade artist\u2019s dream."

"Within seconds of sweeping onstage, and with a wordless gesture as funny as it is subtle, the great actor Brian Bedford proves beyond question that gender is of no importance whatsoever in portraying the imposing Lady Bracknell in Oscar Wilde\u2019s greatest comedy, \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\""
,"Mr. Bedford\u2019s Lady Bracknell enters the drawing room of her nephew Algernon Moncrieff (Santino Fontana) as she would enter any room, with the authority of one who believes firmly in her right to be welcomed anywhere, preferably with tea and cucumber sandwiches. Advancing to greet Algernon, she registers the presence of his friend Jack Worthing (David Furr)."
,"She pauses in dismay, and the grim aspect becomes a little grimmer. The icy blue eyes sweep and pierce, and then the lids slowly descend in a gesture as expressive of disgust as it is possible to imagine. Clearly Lady Bracknell would be most gratified - possibly not surprised, either - if she opened her eyes to discover that Mr. Worthing had had the good breeding to obey her unspoken command and disappear."
,"This magnificent gorgon, \"a monster, without being a myth,\" as the horrified Jack describes her at one point, has perhaps never been more imperious, more indomitable - or more delectably entertaining - than in Mr. Bedford\u2019s brilliant portrayal, the highlight of this effervescent revival of Wilde\u2019s 1895 comedy of manners."
,"Originating at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario, Canada, where I saw it about a year and a half ago, the production, which opened on Thursday night at the American Airlines Theater, courtesy of the Roundabout Theater Company, is also directed by Mr. Bedford, with the same crystalline sharpness he brings to his turn in the play\u2019s most celebrated role."
,"It is not necessarily rare for actors - male actors, that is - to take on the role of Wilde\u2019s arch parody of a paragon of high Victorian propriety. I\u2019ve seen two other productions with men in the part, including an all-male version at the Abbey Theater in Dublin. But Mr. Bedford is truly playing the role, not working a gimmick."
,"A classical actor particularly celebrated for his performances of Shakespeare and Moli\u00E8re, he is a versatile, conscientious stylist who has no interest in winning laughs by winking references to the gender switch. Mr. Bedford is aware that when portrayed with the seriousness of purpose that she deserves - or should I say demands? - Lady Bracknell is more than capable of keeping an audience breathless with laughter, thank you very much."
,"Beneath hats that vaguely suggest menacing birds ready to peck, Mr. Bedford\u2019s expressive face manages to twist itself into any number of memorable grimaces. Causes of distress are myriad, as Lady Bracknell contemplates the peculiar provenance of Mr. Worthing, the handbag-bred fellow who has the temerity to propose marriage to her daughter, Gwendolen Fairfax (Sara Topham), and the sudden infatuation of Algernon for Jack\u2019s young ward, Cecily Cardew (Charlotte Parry)."
,"Mr. Bedford\u2019s stiff posture and serene bustling suggest a woman bearing her rectitude like a suit of armor and her trials with the surety of the righteous. But it is in the expert handling of Wilde\u2019s filigreed language that his portrayal most enchants. Here is a rare stage performance in which, truly, every word is made to count. Mr. Bedford earns hearty laughter when he has just one or two at his disposal - \"Found?\" or \"A handbag?\" - and when he is spinning out one of Lady Bracknell\u2019s priceless upside-down aphorisms, like her immortal observation that \"to lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.\""
,"Mr. Bedford\u2019s delivery of Wilde\u2019s epigrams as if they were entirely natural expressions of character is not easily matched. Mr. Fontana sometimes exudes an air of perky effort as Algernon dispenses curlicued witticisms with the same relish he brings to eating muffins. In the first scene the back and forth between the exasperating Algie and the exasperated Jack lacks the debonair ease of two gentlemen lobbing a feathered shuttlecock in a friendly game of badminton; while Mr. Furr\u2019s crisp irritability is on the mark, Mr. Fontana sometimes lets the bons mots fly as if he were flinging a Frisbee."
,"(Desmond Heeley\u2019s costumes for Mr. Fontana, suggestive of a vaudeville performer, are the designer\u2019s only misstep.)"
,"But Mr. Fontana grows more assured as the show progresses, and the rest of the cast rides the intricate cadences of Wilde\u2019s dialogue with ease."
,"The silken self-satisfaction of Ms. Topham\u2019s Gwendolen is clearly, and amusingly, modeled on that of her mother. She also looks ravishing in Mr. Heeley\u2019s most beautifully wrought costumes."
,"Ms. Parry captures both the natural sweetness and the unnaturally self-dramatizing nature of Cecily. The scene in which these two genteel young Englishwomen sharpen their claws on each other through simpering smiles is perhaps a trifle too close to a catfight than is necessary, but it is very funny indeed."
,"The redoubtable comic actress Dana Ivey gives a savory performance as the priggish Miss Prism, Cecily\u2019s tutor. The mouth is puckered into a disapproving slit when Miss Prism is in pedagogical mode, but a hint of roguishness softens her businesslike demeanor when she is in the presence of the gallant Rev. Canon Chasuble. As this upstanding member of the English clergy, Paxton Whitehead is spot-on in his jovial garrulousness."
,"\"The Importance of Being Earnest\" is the rare work of art that achieves perfection on its own terms. When viewed through the illuminating frame of a fine performance it dazzles both with its light touch and with its sturdy construction, like a cathedral made of spun sugar."
,"Mr. Bedford\u2019s production is not entirely effortless - Wilde\u2019s rococo style can be daunting even to experienced classicists - but it is more buoyant and consistently funny than any I\u2019ve seen. And as Lady Bracknell, Mr. Bedford presides at the cathedral\u2019s altar with supreme skill and stylishness - and a hint of substance too. It\u2019s one of the great performances of the season; to miss it would most definitely look like carelessness."

"description": "The magician Teller directed and helped create this gleefully gruesome frightfest for grown-ups, in which Todd Robbins, noted light-bulb eater and expert in sideshow freakishness, discusses death, afterlife and some particularly creepy historical figures while working some very effective tricks. Screaming is expected, and audience members are subject to being hauled onstage and ghoulishly murdered (1:30).",

"When you see a good show, you like to come away with a keepsake: the ticket stub, the program, perhaps a T-shirt purchased in the lobby. The people behind \"Play Dead\" apparently know this, because they make every effort to send you home with a fellow audience member\u2019s entrails stuck in your hair or lodged in your tote bag."
,"This gleefully grotesque orgy of death and fright, which leaves the Players Theater looking like a movie house after a midnight showing of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" is the creation of the magician Teller, who directs, and Todd Robbins, the main performer, whose areas of expertise include sword swallowing, s\u00E9ances and sideshow freaks. If you find that Halloween haunted houses just don\u2019t do it for you anymore, this just might be the show for you: scarier and smarter."
,"Alas, not much can be said about it in a review without giving away its surprises. This much, though, will certainly not be news to those familiar with Mr. Robbins: He gets things rolling by eating a light bulb, as he has done countless times before, including in his Off Broadway show \"Carnival Knowledge\" in 2003. But that stunt, cringe-inducing as it is, is merely a warm-up. Before long carnage breaks out, much of it involving ticket-holders who are brought onstage. Thus those entrails in your hair."
,"Screaming is not just encouraged, it\u2019s more or less unavoidable. But the show isn\u2019t merely cheap laughs and frights for grown-ups; it\u2019s a history lesson, in a macabre sort of way. Amid the tricks and illusions the genial Mr. Robbins tells the stories of people like Albert Fish, a killer and eater of children, and Mina Crandon, a Massachusetts medium who apparently had some unconventional ideas about clothing, or lack of it."
,"Perhaps strangest of all in this cornucopia of strangeness, when Mr. Robbins talks about Dorothy R. Bembridge, a woman he knew who, in her 80s, was murdered, he manages to inject some poignancy into the proceedings. That\u2019s when you know that this wild, wicked show is not just a screamfest after all; it\u2019s a pretty good piece of theater."
